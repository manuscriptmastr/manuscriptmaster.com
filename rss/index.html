<p>I'm loving every second at <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com/">DigitalCrafts</a> as a Developer in Residence (teaching assistant). Alumni from my first cohort are now being hired, coming back as DIRs, and actively searching for their first job as web developers.</p>
<p>Career switching is a roller coaster, and depending on the time of day, being a coding bootcamp alumnus means either celebrating with confetti emoji or scouring LinkedIn for job postings.</p>
<p>You might be from that majority that was not offered a job straight out of bootcamp. You're currently navigating the maze of applications, recruiters, and coffee meetups while trying to keep the rust off your new skillset.</p>
<p>In other industries, an alumnus asks, &quot;How do I keep up my current skills?&quot; But as a new developer, you face an evergreen industry: tech changes every day and <em>today's innovation is branded as tomorrow's legacy.</em> It might be better to ask yourself, &quot;How do I stay relevant?&quot;</p>
<p>Surviving means becoming a perpetual learner.</p>
<p>So as you search for the right opportunity, here’s some advice to keep your mind sharp and survive job hunting season.</p>
<h2 id="step1dispelthemagic">Step 1: Dispel the magic</h2>
<p>No matter how amazing your bootcamp instructor was, there will be pieces of magic that you never quite understood. When I started programming two years ago, I took many concepts on faith—like callbacks and promises—without understanding their motivation and inner workings. It wasn't until I DIRed my first cohort that I finally squashed some of those &quot;brain bugs.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Close your mental gaps by starting your new projects from scratch.</strong> Copy pasting from previous projects is the top source of confusion and frustration for new developers. So seize this chance to question the reason for every single line, then <strong>boldly remove magical code and see what breaks.</strong></p>
<h2 id="step2takecontrolofarchitecture">Step 2: Take control of architecture</h2>
<p>Now that you've seen the bigger picture of building a full-stack application, you have the intuition to break up sprawling files into concrete modules that have a clearly defined input and output.</p>
<p>If you're unsure where to begin solving a problem, write it down in English (optionally, Norwegian) before you solve it in JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Name functions before defining them.</strong> You're describing the architecture of your solution and defining what your &quot;building block&quot; functions accept and return—never mind how they work at this point. This approach trains you to separate concerns and save the spaghetti for dinner, <em>not your git repo.</em></p>
<h2 id="step3readmoredocsandfewerstackoverflows">Step 3: Read more docs and fewer Stack Overflows</h2>
<p>Unless you're trying to exit Vim, <strong>docs are the definitive answer</strong> for how to best use a library because:</p>
<ol>
<li>They explain how to properly use it.</li>
<li>The examples are isolated from other libraries.</li>
<li>They define what methods accept and return.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Stack Overflow threads often confuse programmers with noisy answers</strong> that solve the problem by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hacking the library.</li>
<li>Adding other libraries.</li>
<li>Sidestepping the underlying issue.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step4askcolleaguesinsteadofinstructors">Step 4: Ask colleagues instead of instructors</h2>
<p>Our instructors are the kindest and most brilliant people in the world, and they sometimes save us from the struggles we should go through ourselves.</p>
<p>After graduation, your fellow alumni are now your best resource. They've likely used the tool you're trying out and can help you understand the problems it solves without giving you the <em>one solution to rule them all.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unless you need life advice, you should ask your peers.</strong></p>
<h2 id="step5integratelibrariesyouveneverused">Step 5: Integrate libraries you've never used</h2>
<p>There are thousands of awesome open source tools out there, and there's no better way to shorten your learning curve than by implementing at least one new tool per project. Some of the students built React Native projects for their final demo and were challenged by the paradigm shift that comes with a mobile platform.</p>
<h2 id="lifegoeson">Life Goes On</h2>
<p>Your life after Demo Day could be either the most boring or most exciting season of your new career path. You now have the opportunity to work on exactly the skills you want to develop, and there's no greater time to master <a href="http://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html">higher order learning</a>.</p>
<p>Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Be confident and remember you will always be an ignoramus like everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Never stop learning.</strong></p>

<img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2017/06/Trello.jpg" alt="Your Boss Will Love You: 5 Universal Skills Programming Teaches You."><p><img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2017/06/IMG_7445-1.jpg" alt="Your Boss Will Love You: 5 Universal Skills Programming Teaches You."></p>
<p>I graduated with a B.M. in Piano Performance. Surrounded by Steinways, symphonies and stickies (see above), I left college assuming that music was all I could—or <em>should</em>—be doing professionally.</p>
<p>Sixteen hours after nailing my Senior Recital, I watched <a href="https://www.yellowscale.com/">my twin brother</a> receive his diploma as a Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket with a B.S. in Computer Science. I never understood what a fun guy like Jonathan found so fascinating about a tech field. <strong>To me, programming was more about circuitry than creativity.</strong></p>
<p>Fast-forward 3 years to September 2016, when I picked up a menacingly thick red book entitled “<a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/front-end-web-development/">Front-End Web Development: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a>.” It was a dare from Jonathan—I read the book three times before I understood [any] of it.</p>
<p>Several Codecademy/Udacity courses, algorithm books, tutorials and <a href="https://github.com/manuscriptmastr/coffeegram">a shipped Node app</a> later, I’ve discovered that not only is coding creative, it challenges you to think about <em>everything</em> in a completely novel way and forces you to cultivate solid work principles to which other professions only pay lip service.</p>
<p>In the interest of <em>biasing toward shipping,</em> I will condense eight months of learning to <strong>5 programming skills you can apply to any profession.</strong></p>
<h2 id="1learntolearn">1. Learn to Learn</h2>
<p>When learning a foreign language, you are associating familiar ideas with new terms. But to learn the language a computer understands, you must adopt a mindset completely foreign to the way a human brain normally processes information. Computer Science is the adolescent of the academic disciplines and is evolving daily as we find new ways to leverage technology. A developer thrown into this context is challenged to cultivate radical learning habits:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to arrive at the same solution through different approaches. Your ability to view information through a gamut of lenses is critical to communication, teaching and problem solving.</li>
<li>How to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. You will never master your field, so curiosity is your greatest asset…and your only hope of job security!</li>
<li>How to abstract and implement design patterns from an example. You may not be able to fully understand someone else’s work, but you can replicate their approach and apply it in your own work.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2prioritizetasks">2. Prioritize Tasks</h2>
<p>It’s easy to complete tasks when they’re handed down to you, but programming often requires dual skill sets as “expert” and “project manager.” Your app’s success depends on your ability to sift through an ocean of good ideas and pick only what’s necessary to make it functional <em>now.</em> In the field of music composition, you can start anywhere in your project; in coding, you have to build your application layer-by-layer so it is usable at any stage.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/377435/screenshots/1753131/redisflat_mvp.png" alt="Your Boss Will Love You: 5 Universal Skills Programming Teaches You." title="MVP Diagram"></p>
<p>Simple planning tools like <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> and <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a> make it obvious what features are core to your project’s value. Have a cool idea? Compare it to your other ideas and decide where it fits in the scope of your project. A styled-up user interface for your banking app is not half as critical as encrypting user data or designing your server to gracefully handle errors.</p>
<p>The punchline for non-programmers? <strong>Ask yourself what is preventing you from sharing your project with the world, and move those items to the top of your to-do list.</strong></p>
<h2 id="3iteratetoperfection">3. Iterate to Perfection</h2>
<p>The first time I was ever called a “perfectionist” was in my high school precalculus class, when my math teacher noticed how precisely I drew my graphs for a test.</p>
<p>Luckily, programming practices help bound perfectionist tendencies. Code can always be refactored and class names can always be improved (<em>can I get a witness?</em>), so the only way to get something done is to <strong>bias toward shipping</strong> to make your application a <strong>minimum viable product</strong> (MVP for short). Here are a few mantras developers abide by to steer their projects to success:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write an isolated chunk of code that accomplishes one thing. Not two-and-a-half things.</li>
<li>Ship now. Write code that works today.</li>
<li>Iterate later. Optimize your existing codebase as the scope and complexity of your project grows.</li>
</ol>
<p>What if you’re not a programmer? These principles are just as applicable in your workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a solution that solves one well-defined problem.</li>
<li>Ship a unit that has measurable impact today.</li>
<li>Note areas for improvement in your solution and address them in another iteration.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4embraceproblemsolving">4. Embrace Problem Solving</h2>
<p>It’s the skill every profession is looking for and no one likes the sound of. Personally, it reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Brinker,_or_The_Silver_Skates#Popular_culture:_the_legend_of_the_boy_and_the_dike">that little Dutch boy</a> plugging up leaks in the Holland dike. <strong>Who wants to have a career in catastrophe prevention?</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully in the dev world, <strong>problem solving</strong> is an innovative, intuition-driven process that <em>creates</em> value. Instead of fixing a previous problem or pressing issue, you are entering a new frontier and brainstorming an elegant solution to the problem at hand that feels like a work of art <em>and</em> meets consumer needs. <strong>A good problem solver can turn an ugly problem into a <em>beautiful solution.</em></strong></p>
<p>Humans are fabulous at improvising solutions to complicated problems on the fly, but computers have to be pre-taught every nuance, edge case and error. Thinking like a computer—with no foresight or intuition—trains you to fully grasp both the problem and the solution by adopting effective strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define the problem. Explain what you are solving to another person, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">buy a rubber duck</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis">Divide and conquer</a>. Break up an unapproachable problem into smaller problems that can be tackled one at a time so that demonstrable progress can be made. <em>Where</em> to divide is often more important than <em>how.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(complexity)">Reduction</a>. Transform a problem into another well-known problem for which there is a well-known solution.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="5fostercollaborativehabits">5. Foster Collaborative Habits</h2>
<p>Collaboration is the gold standard of business, but it often tastes like that grade from a college group project: <em>sour.</em> You probably could have done it better by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration is not like a college group project.</strong> It’s not about dividing up work. It’s not even about recruiting extra manpower.</p>
<p>In fact, you can collaborate with yourself!</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> [good] collaboration? It’s an approach for accomplishing measurable results, built on these tenets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Communicate frequently. Set mutual expectations, touch base regularly, and identify obstacles.</li>
<li>Make yourself replaceable, a.k.a. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">Bus Factor</a>. If you got hit by a bus, could someone take your place?</li>
<li>Leverage individual expertise. Chances are you’re not (1) all-knowing, (2) brimming with infinite time or (3) perfect. Let your colleagues in on the areas you don’t specialize in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most non-trivial applications require more than one developer, so when your code represents just a smidgen of the project, you <em>must</em> play nicely with other contributors for your work to be meaningful. <strong>Modularizing your code, following style guides and making your code readable are just a few of the techniques developers have honed to make collaboration sweet.</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>TL;DR:</em> You should become a programmer, right?</p>
<p>Whether or not you plan to hop into the command line after reading this article, I hope you’ve gleaned some insight <em>into the way that effective developers work.</em> And by championing the 5 universal skills of programming in your own work, <em>you will stand out in any profession.</em></p>
<p>There’s one other lesson programming has taught me: that I <em>can</em> learn something new. Make it <em>your</em> maxim to stretch (and break) your brain. <strong>Don’t ever underestimate your ability to learn new things.</strong></p>
<p>Happy working!</p>

<p>I also happen to be a composer who churns out multi-stave music for orchestra, chamber groups, and chorus.</p>
<p>There is unfortunately little information online about whether the MacBook can run hardcore music programs like Logic Pro, Pro Tools, Finale, or Sibelius, and few musicians are willing to risk a grand to experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Can the MacBook be your primary computer as a musician?</strong> After reading my experiences, I hope you’ll be closer to answering that question for yourself.</p>
<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
<p>We all have unique goals for our music, so our tools, workflows, and benchmarks will differ. Let me set the context in which I work—if my needs differ significantly from yours, my experience may be irrelevant to your decision.</p>
<p><strong>I am a classical composer.</strong> I write almost exclusively orchestral and chamber music, though I’ve branched out into film scoring and church arranging. Check out my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/manuscriptmastr/i-prelude" title="I. Prelude (Hebrews Song Cycle)">brand new recording for chorus and piano</a> on SoundCloud when you get a chance!</p>
<p><strong>I am also a (noob) front end web developer.</strong> Don’t ask how I came to join the Dark Side, but if you’re interested in how that affects my compositional workflow, you should read my blog about the <a href="http://www.manuscriptmastr.com/whats-wrong-with-notation-software-and-how-to-fix-it" title="What's Wrong with Notation Software? And How to Fix It.">perfect notation software</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I am a writer.</strong> Most of my ponderings concern music, though you’ll find the occasional short story and faith treatise interspersed throughout my feed.</p>
<h2 id="mycurrentworkstation">My Current Workstation</h2>
<p>Till now, my primary machine had been a 2011 13-inch MacBook Pro. Thanks to a 2.3 GHz processor and an upgraded 256 GB solid-state drive, it is still kicking hard.</p>
<p>I don’t use many peripherals other than an external MIDI keyboard and an Apple keyboard. I use my computer 70% of the time for correspondence, browsing, music listening, and general writing; the other 30% is split between Finale and Logic Pro. I work primarily with virtual instruments and MIDI input, but I occasionally manipulate audio.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>With those circumstances in mind, I originally eyed the 2016 MacBook Pro as my next machine.</p>
<p><em>Until the October keynote.</em> After four years of minimal upgrades, the newest MacBook Pro boasts a slower CPU, a Touch Bar (not even available on the entry-level model), and a slightly smaller body. Oh yes, and a $200 price increase.</p>
<p>Many smartly opted for the 2015 MacBook Pro instead, but I decided to investigate the 12-inch MacBook.</p>
<p>Probably the most polarizing product in Apple’s current lineup, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/" title="Apple | MacBook">the MacBook</a> uses a Core M processor, a terraced battery design, and a single USB-C port to create one of the lightest, thinnest computers on the market. Apple has hailed it “the future of the notebook,” but it goes by other, less favorable descriptions like “a laptop without an ecosystem” and “a fashion statement for cappuccino-sipping millennials.” (I made up that last one.)</p>
<p>The music industry has reached a similar consensus: the MacBook lacks the muscles to function as a music workhorse, considering its weak mobile processor, limited screen space, and lack of contemporary ports. It was for these same reasons I originally wrote off Apple’s metal miracle.</p>
<p>Why did I reconsider the MacBook?</p>
<p><strong>The CPU was unlikely to be the limiting factor in my workflow.</strong> The processor’s importance is often exaggerated in the industry, and the biggest point of confusion is in how multi-core CPUs work. Most computers (including my 2011 MacBook Pro and the new MacBook) use at least two CPUs, and many modern programs (including Logic Pro and Finale) take advantage of the double capacity by splitting up tasks between the two. So when Activity Monitor tells me a program is using 105% of my CPU, that’s just over half of my total processing power (200%). Running large orchestral projects on my 2.3 GHz MacBook Pro used anywhere from 15–60%…out of 200%! If I opted for the slower 1.1 GHz MacBook, I might max out at 120% CPU out of 200%, which would still be plenty.</p>
<p>For me, <em>a solid-state drive was the limiting reagent.</em> I recently upgraded the hard drive in my 2011 MacBook Pro to a solid-state drive, and while I expected it to be faster, I was not prepared for an <em>entirely new computer experience.</em> The display may be a little outdated, but it now runs like it was built yesterday, and programs like Logic Pro and Finale run effortlessly since the hard drive swap. And that’s considering the machine already sported a 2.3 GHz <em>dual-core processor.</em></p>
<p>Another point of confusion: <em>Logic Pro’s processing needs are often misleadingly compared with those of video-rendering programs (like Final Cut Pro).</em> To the contrary, high-definition video editing requires far more processing power (and other specs, like GPU) than audio or MIDI editing. Considering that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIDx9yIcj0s" title="MacBook 1.2 Ghz—Photoshop - Logic Pro X - Final Cut Pro X &amp; Team Fortress 2 [4K]">MacBook can in fact run Logic Pro</a>, I concluded it should be able to effectively run other programs like Finale.</p>
<p><strong>The 12-inch display provided plenty of screen estate.</strong> Losing an inch would be an easy transition for me after working on a 13-inch computer for the last five years. I find myself often relocating my workstation to the piano, coffee shop, or church office, so portability and a sharp display are equally valuable assets to my workflow.</p>
<p><strong>An external port hub would easily make up for the MacBook’s single USB-C port and even streamline my workstation.</strong> My mobile workflow often means I am unplugging three peripherals at a time just to test out a passage on the piano; using a single dongle as my permanent hub would be a welcome (albeit minor) optimization. And since I never take peripherals like a MIDI keyboard or numpad on the road with me, the dongle would also stay docked at homebase.</p>
<h2 id="firstimpressions">First Impressions</h2>
<p>After much deliberation, I finally grabbed the MacBook during a Black Friday deal. I opted for the entry-level model (1.1 GHz m3 processor, 256 GB solid-state drive) and an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D0WE99C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1?tag=" title="Anker Hub">Anker 3 USB 3.1 Hub with Power Delivery</a>.</p>
<p>When I opened the box, my first thought was, <em>where is the rest of the computer?</em> The MacBook is thinner than a 4th generation iPad, and only half a pound heavier.</p>
<p>At this size, <strong>the last thing I expected to surprise me was the MacBook’s speakers.</strong> In fact, they <em>triggered momentary cardiac arrest.</em> This feather-light machine has killer speakers that are louder <em>and clearer</em> than a 2015 MacBook Pro. It may not have the strongest bass, but I ditched my external speakers after listening to music on the 12-inch MacBook with <em>pleasure.</em> The only downside to such loud speakers is that you can hear noise in recordings at full volume, though it’s difficult to tell how much of this is the MacBook’s fault. While an odd frequency may cause a slight “buzz,” it doesn’t detract from the overall brilliant audio experience.</p>
<p>The display is an incredible sight after years of working on a non-Retina machine. I typically wear glasses for computer work, but ironically I find myself using them less for the smaller MacBook. I even scaled my display for more space (System Preferences-&gt;Displays-&gt;Scaled-&gt;More Space) and boosted text size by 10% in my browser (Command +).</p>
<p>I love the MacBook keyboard’s light, crisp touch. It has the addictive “click” I crave and minimalist key travel that the energy-conserving pianist in me appreciates. The customizable Force Touch trackpad is also a welcome update.</p>
<p>Peripherals are no problem thanks to the Anker hub; my powered hard drive works blazingly fast, even with other devices plugged in.</p>
<p>Added bonus: the MacBook doesn’t huff and puff like MacBook Pros, since it has no fan.</p>
<h2 id="musicsoftwarebenchmarks">Music Software Benchmarks</h2>
<p>After initial setup, I downloaded my two chief productivity apps, <strong>Finale v. 25</strong> and <strong>Logic Pro X.</strong></p>
<p>To test the MacBook’s ability to handle large-scale works, I opened a 23-stave orchestral score in Finale. For the first time, <strong>Finale’s interface actually looked <em>pretty</em></strong> thanks to the Retina display. Instrument loading was faster than ever, while playback was silky smooth and even allowed me to simultaneously navigate around the document with minimal lag. I kept an eye on Activity Monitor while opening other programs, and clearly <em>the MacBook was yawning</em> in playback mode. At the score’s busiest section, Finale used 115% of my processor. (Again, this is out of 200% because Finale leverages dual-core technology.)</p>
<p>I attempted note input and was initially dismayed at the half-second lag between clicking and the note rendering on my score. Unfortunately, <strong>this performance bug plagues even the highest spec’ed iMacs.</strong> Finale is not yet fully optimized to render in Retina display, and hence something as simple as note input makes brand new computers feel old. (I am told the folks at Finale have made this issue a foremost priority, but fixing the lag involves drastic changes to the program.) In other words, <em>the lag had nothing to do with the MacBook’s capabilities.</em> By toggling Finale to open in non-Retina mode (Finder-&gt;Applications-&gt;Finale-&gt;Get Info-&gt;Open in Low Resolution), note input became instant, although it isn’t the prettiest.</p>
<p>In Logic, I tested several VST projects: 10, 14, and 16 tracks. Playback and simultaneous navigation was <em>buttery smooth</em> in each project. The 14-track project required anywhere from 20–35% CPU.</p>
<p>To test MIDI recording, I recorded a 17th track on top of my 16-track project. Again, the MacBook kept up easily, with CPU usage maxing at 88% (of 200%). At this rate, the MacBook has more processing power than I need to put together full orchestral demos.</p>
<p>Bouncing the 10-track, 5-minute VST project to an MP4 file at 256 kbps took just under 45 seconds—not remarkable, but a solid performance from a MacBook.</p>
<p>It is interesting that between the two apps, Logic Pro performed the best. Its architecture takes better advantage of Mac hardware, whereas Finale (despite some ambitious core upgrades) still runs subpar even on high-spec’ed Macs.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Before I upgraded to a MacBook, I assumed that I used much more of my computer’s specs than I really did. Not only was my self-perception as a “power user” incorrect, <em>I have been shocked at how much the “low-spec’ed” MacBook can handle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Can the 12-inch MacBook run your music productivity software capably?</strong> Absolutely! If you’re a composer writing orchestral music in Finale or creating multi-track demos in Logic Pro, the MacBook will do everything you want for a lower starting price than the MacBook Pro. Not to mention it’s super light and portable for the power!</p>

<p>This widespread distrust is merited in part. Salesmen work under enormous pressure to make sales, and since failure to meet sales goals equals no commission or the pink slip, they often resort to aggressive behavior to survive. While these business “sharks” do prowl the economic sea (i.e. your neighborhood or mall), there are salesmen who meet their goals without biting your leg off.</p>
<p>Great salesmen see you as a person, <em><strong>not their next meal.</strong></em></p>
<p>They are knowledgeable and passionate about their product.</p>
<p>They understand you have needs that their product can fulfill.</p>
<h2 id="youjustcalledmeawhat">You just called me a <em>what?</em></h2>
<p>Believe it or not, if you’re a Christian, you’re in the sales industry, employed by a Heavenly Boss. You’ve been given a commission to fulfill…a <em>Great Commission:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Jesus came up and spoke to them [the eleven disciples], saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18-20&amp;version=NASB" title="Matthew 28:18–20">Matthew 28:18–20</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus was not making a suggestion to His disciples—He was giving them a job with a tangible goal. Throughout the book of Acts, we see the eleven apostles also commissioning other disciples (most notably Paul and Barnabas) to spread the Gospel. This great mandate was intended to be practiced by every believer.</p>
<p>It’s been nearly two thousand years, and the commission still stands: <strong><em>everyone</em> is a salesman.</strong> If you have a personal relationship with God through His Son, you have a product to sell. Clientele to engage. And goals to meet.</p>
<p>How are you doing?</p>
<p>Let’s examine the characteristics of a <em>good</em> salesman.</p>
<h2 id="theeighthabitsofhighlyeffectivesalesmen">The Eight Habits of Highly Effective Salesmen</h2>
<p>Forget all those “sharks” who leave you dizzy with useless products in your hand (if they haven’t already bitten it off). Every good salesman:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Learns about the client and his individual needs.</strong> Selling a product that doesn’t address the actual problem means a return and/or business with a competitor.</li>
<li><strong>Builds a rapport with the client.</strong> Relationships equal repeat business and a pleasant experience for the client.</li>
<li><strong>Intentionally engages his market.</strong> Salesmen who lie around waiting for a sale to fall in their lap may have something else fall into their lap (like an <a href="https://youtu.be/oqCQuiq6eOo?t=30s" title="Bully for Bugs">ACME anvil</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Understands his “niche” market.</strong> Advertising a tractor outlet on a downtown Atlanta billboard isn’t the greatest idea.</li>
<li><strong>Engages his client as an equal, not an inferior.</strong> This is what distinguishes a “shark” from a good salesman—no one likes being treated like an ignoramus.</li>
<li><strong>Knows his product.</strong> He is passionate about his product and understands its potential to fix problems.</li>
<li><strong>Overcomes objections to the product.</strong> When a potential client brings up concerns about the product, the salesman can address his objections with an intelligent rebuttal.</li>
<li><strong>Does not quit after a bad engagement.</strong> That’s just asking for the pink slip. A hardcore salesman understands that every prospective client has a free will.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well-rounded salesmen who apply these strategies make high sales <em>and</em> foster loyal clientele.</p>
<p>If you are a Christian (hence a salesman), you can apply all of these habits to your witnessing life…</p>
<h2 id="iobjectyourhonor">“…I Object, Your Honor!”</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re just a tad disgusted at equating a good sales interaction with a good witnessing experience. <em>Those tips are nice,</em> you’re saying, <em>but what’s that got to do with my faith?</em></p>
<p>Before I draw the parallel between sales and witnessing, let’s establish some big ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every human being is in the market for the Gospel.</li>
<li>You are selling a relationship, not a product.</li>
<li>You cannot save anybody.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless you have Clarence Odbody for your next-door neighbor, he needs your product. Desperately. And your product is a lifesaving relationship with God Himself. Now, you can beg him to accept it, you can argue with him, you can persuade him, but you cannot save him anymore than you can make someone open up their wallet and buy into Jesus. (Unless you’re holding him at gunpoint—bet that would be an effective tactic!)</p>
<p>Let’s kill two of the biggest myths about witnessing:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should wait for people to ask you about your faith.</li>
<li>Don’t use words; just live out your faith and people will accept Jesus when they see your example.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Myth No. 1</strong> assumes that people know (1) they have an eternal problem and (2) Jesus is the final solution. Yes, everyone has a conscience that testifies to their sin, but passages like <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3%3A15-18&amp;version=NASB" title="2 Corinthians 3:15–18">2 Corinthians 3:15–18</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+4%3A3-6&amp;version=NASB" title="2 Corinthians 4:3–6">4:3–6</a> testify to a “veil” or spiritual blindness that is removed from the unbeliever only when he turns to God. Besides that, there are many products that claim to fix their problem: Hinduism, Islam, Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses. Some products even fix the problem by claiming the problem doesn’t exist (e.g. Atheism and Buddhism, both of which deny original sin).</p>
<p><strong>Myth No. 2</strong> remains one of the most widespread lies still hovering around the pulpits today. Nowhere in Scripture do we see the spoken word separated from salvation (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A14-15&amp;version=NASB" title="Romans 10:14–15">Romans 10:14–15</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+2%3A15-17&amp;version=NASB" title="2 Corinthians 2:15–17">2 Corinthians 2:15–17</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+4%3A13-14&amp;version=NASB" title="2 Corinthians 4:13–14">2 Corinthians 4:13–14</a>). John the Baptist, Jesus, Peter, and Paul all proclaimed the message of Christ’s sacrifice verbally while leading righteous lives.</p>
<h2 id="drawingtheparallel">Drawing the Parallel</h2>
<p>Now that we have cleared the air a bit, let’s see how the eight habits of effective salesmen translate to the discipline of witnessing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Learn about the client and his individual needs.</strong> Everyone has a story and a reason for being where they are. To be an effective witness, you need to understand where your “client” is coming from so you can tailor your presentation without distorting the product: a relationship with God through Jesus.</li>
<li><strong>Build a rapport with the client.</strong> You are reaching out to your “client” ultimately because you care about his future. Show it by investing in him with your time and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Intentionally engage your market.</strong> Don’t wait for your client to find you; seek out the lost and present the Gospel. Chances are that he doesn’t understand the value of your product.</li>
<li><strong>Understand your “niche” market.</strong> Concepts like sin, sacrifices, and holiness have all but disappeared from the cultural backbone. You need to understand what kind of people you are sharing the Gospel with and what areas will need explanation. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17%3A16-34&amp;version=NASB" title="Acts 17:16–34">The Sermon on Mars Hill</a> is a brilliant example of this cultural awareness.)</li>
<li><strong>Engage your client as an equal, not an inferior.</strong> You were once dead in your sin, too. Share the truth, but with “gentleness and reverence” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:14-16&amp;version=NASB" title="1 Peter 3:14–16">1 Peter 3:14–16</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Know your product.</strong> Do you realize the benefits of being reconciled to your Heavenly Father? Study your product so you can passionately share why it’s the greatest thing in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Overcome objections to the product.</strong> Our secularly-educated culture has been conditioned to dismiss the spiritual dimension, absolute morality, and Biblical accuracy. You need to be apologetically-minded (equipped with solid answers) to clear away any misconceptions that are keeping your client from understanding and accepting this lifesaving product.</li>
<li><strong>Do not quit after a bad engagement.</strong> There is no secular discipline that subscribes to this attitude; why should we trivialize soul fishing by shelving it after one bad experience? Not everyone will accept the product. Your Heavenly Boss has given you the command to preach the Gospel, and He will bless your engagements. Even the seasoned salesmen Paul and Apollos recognized that they could only plant seeds and water them—not cause them to grow (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A5-7&amp;version=NASB" title="1 Corinthians 3:5–7">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="goanddothesame">Go and Do the Same</h2>
<p>I admit, when I first considered this topic—paralleling witnessing with selling—I was a little disturbed. However, the further I examined the traits of <em>good</em> salesmanship and applied them to my faith, the more I realized that this fits the Biblical mindset. <em>Laissez-faire</em> proselytization will not do—ultimately, my laxity belittles the eternal destination of a human soul. We need to witness with intelligence, concern, and tenacity.</p>
<p>Thinking like a salesman has radically transformed how I think about sharing my faith; hopefully it has also given you food for thought <em>and</em> application.</p>

<img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2016/02/Finale.png" alt="What's Wrong With Notation Software? And How To Fix It."><p>Okay, I have a dark, dark secret—if this gets out, my music career is done. You have to <em>promise</em> not to tell anyone what I’m about to confess. Here goes.</p>
<p><em><strong>I have a software developer for a brother.</strong></em></p>
<p>There, I said it. Shocking news. While I slave away at Finale and double thirds, my brother spells the world’s end on a computer keyboard.</p>
<p>There is nothing more boring, ugly, or scary in my mind than <em>code</em>—and ironically, there is nothing more dynamic, beautiful, and empowering to a developer than that string of random characters which makes magic happen.</p>
<p>Software developers really know how to use a computer, whether we like their nerdy glasses or not. (Most don’t own a pair.) They know how to be efficient, clean, and organized when creating coded masterpieces (at least if they’re good).</p>
<p>They’re the people who put “Google” in the dictionary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you and I feel brilliant when we text a cat emoji. Is it time we composers took a cue from the computer industry and improved our own programs?</p>
<h2 id="whatswrongwithnotationsoftware">What’s Wrong With Notation Software?</h2>
<p>Decades have passed since the first music notation software hit the market, and since then, we’ve seen other champions carry the torch—<a href="http://www.finalemusic.com/" title="Finale">Finale</a> and <a href="http://www.sibelius.com/home/index_flash.html" title="Sibelius">Sibelius</a>. Then there’s <a href="https://musescore.org/" title="MuseScore">MuseScore</a>, the open source project (developer lingo: a software project anyone can use or contribute to).</p>
<p>There’s plenty of options out there. And there’s plenty of complaints…</p>
<p>“Such-and-such is too stupid to hide my rests when I do multiple voices!”</p>
<p>“Can’t such-and-such figure out that my slurs are overlapping?”</p>
<p>“It’s so cluttered! Too many features!”</p>
<p>“Give me such-and-such a feature and I’ll be happy!”</p>
<p>Sound familiar? I’ve made these kinds of statements regularly, typically after spending three hours trying to diagnose a problem. It’s obvious that there is a disconnect between the user (that’s you!) and computer in most notation softwares—and it may be our fault. But contrary to popular opinion, the <strong>answer to a better program is not more features and infinitesimal manual editing.</strong></p>
<p>All these problems are symptoms of one philosophical flaw: we composers don’t know how to use a computer <em>well.</em> And so, we create (and use) softwares that operate from the wrong premise.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to start writing programs and interacting with our computers in a way that is “idiomatic” to our “instrument.”</p>
<p>But to do that, we first need to learn a few things about our electrical workhorses.</p>
<h2 id="computerphilosophy101">Computer Philosophy 101</h2>
<p>Let’s go back to the drawing board. What makes a computer program work best for both the user and computer?</p>
<p>Pretty icons?</p>
<p>Tons of features?</p>
<p>These are all great assets, but the ultimate goal of productivity software should always be efficiency: <em>how can we leverage features, input (how the user gives the computer data), and automation (what the computer does with the data) to speed up workflow?</em></p>
<p>If efficiency’s the mantra, that leads us to four key premises:</p>
<p><strong>The user-computer workflow is most efficient when:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The keyboard is the primary input device.</li>
<li>We restrict ourselves to the creative input, while the computer realizes our data.</li>
<li>External hardware is not integral to the workflow.</li>
<li>The workflow is free of distractions and context switches.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds like I pulled those out of thin air, right? Let’s break down the reasoning behind these four ideas.</p>
<p><strong>1. The user-computer workflow is most efficient when the keyboard is the primary input device.</strong> Unless you’re composing on your tablet (any <a href="http://www.staffpad.net/" title="StaffPad">StaffPad</a> users?), <a href="https://youtu.be/JnMEI4aoUfo?t=1h15m50s" title="Hansel and Gretel">nibbling-little-mousy</a> is the fastest way to lose your inspiration—and maybe your job too. It’s just too slow. Why not use the 38+ buttons available on your keyboard? Put those fast fingers to good use: the dumb QWERTY keyboard is the best input method for creating data on a computer. (At least for now.)</p>
<p><strong>2. The user-computer workflow is most efficient when we restrict ourselves to the creative input, while the computer realizes our data.</strong> How much time do you spend editing things that don’t change the heart of your information? The computer—and notation software logic—has come a long way in correctly handling data to the last nitty-gritty detail, from collisions to chord accidental placement. We need to focus on giving the computer the important information and create a killer program that executes the mundane details pixel-perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>3. The user-computer workflow is most efficient when external hardware is not integral to the workflow.</strong> That doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with MIDI keyboards or numpads, but when we’re on the go we shouldn’t have to lug them around or miss a deadline. (Equals starvation.) A self-sufficient computer program would do wonders in boosting our creativity and productivity, regardless of where we choose to work. Besides, I’ve always wanted to compose on top of Half Dome, and who wants to carry around a Motif and a junky numpad?</p>
<p><strong>4. The user-computer workflow is…</strong></p>
<p><em>…Ooh, shiny!</em></p>
<p><strong>…most efficient when it is free of distractions and context switches.</strong> We should be able to perform 99% of the creative process without changing windows or tools (i.e. clicking with a mouse). Also, is there anything more distracting to an artist than a cluttered screen of buttons? Efficient software majors on the content and minors on the tool palette. Because let’s face it, we artists are visually <s>distracted</s> stimulated, and keyboard shortcuts are a better workflow anyway.</p>
<h2 id="industriesthatgetitright">Industries That Get it Right</h2>
<p>So we now have an idea of what the perfect program looks like. Are there any programs that make the cut?</p>
<p>I told you earlier that programmers really know how to use a computer, and while I don’t want to scare you away with their programs (check out <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vim">Vim</a> if you dare), I’d love to show you how different industries have applied the four premises to creative software. (Wait, you mean programmers aren’t creative?)</p>
<p>Modern-day writers rely on the computer for all their creative work. Word processors like Word and Pages are certainly life-savers after having wasted thousands of years worth of feathers, but they still don’t meet the criteria for an efficient program. After all, we spend a lot of our time clicking to italicize or bold phrases (see premise 1); playing with fonts/sizes/colors/layout, which have nothing to do with the pertinent information and get ruined when opened in another platform (2); and biting our fingernails because the distracting UI throws off our concentration (4).</p>
<p>Enter the perfect word processing program: Ulysses.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2016/02/Ulysses-1-1.png" alt="What's Wrong With Notation Software? And How To Fix It."></p>
<p><img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2016/02/Ulysses-2-2.png" alt="What's Wrong With Notation Software? And How To Fix It."></p>
<p>Looks too simple to be powerful, right? How does this beast work?</p>
<p>Well, most word processors include styling and advanced formatting in the creative process, but Ulysses restricts you to words. <em>Gasp!</em> No fancy buttons to change your font, no click-and-drag method to insert a picture. But of course, we all need basic formatting like bullet lists, headers, and block quotes, so Ulysses uses a language called Markdown. It’s an <em>itty-bitty</em> language that associates certain characters (i.e asterisks or dashes) with basic formatting (i.e. italics or bullet points). And when you’re finished with your document, you can export it to a style of your choice with one click.</p>
<p>This:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2016/02/Ulysses-2-3.png" alt="What's Wrong With Notation Software? And How To Fix It."></p>
<p>Becomes this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2016/02/Ulysses-3-1.png" alt="What's Wrong With Notation Software? And How To Fix It."></p>
<p>It cuts out the inessential edits from the writing process. (And in an immersive way, too!) Which means it’s easy to give the computer “clean data” so that it can handle styling with meticulous precision (i.e. no differently sized bullets and accidental color changes). This program handles all four elements of efficiency elegantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard-centric, including basic formatting.</li>
<li>User-computer balance (fewer worries about being locked down to a particular program or operating system).</li>
<li>Of course, no external hardware. Your workflow on top of Mt. Kilimanjaro is just as efficient as it is in your studio.</li>
<li>A clean, distraction-free interface that literally puts your content center stage (I write all my blogs, including this one, in Ulysses).</li>
</ul>
<p>Word processing isn’t the only industry that’s catching on. Some blogging platforms are simplifying the website creation process, like <a href="https://ghost.org/" title="Ghost">Ghost</a>. Before I switched to this open source service, I used Apple iWeb and WordPress to publish my website—both created visually appealing results, but had complex, manual-heavy UI’s. Ghost operates under a totally different, WYSIWYG aesthetic (What You See Is What You Get).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2016/02/Ghost-1.png" alt="What's Wrong With Notation Software? And How To Fix It."></p>
<p>Like Ulysses, Ghost uses Markdown and a parallel view to transform words and characters into a fully-styled blog. While this platform is hardcore-focused at the blogging community and may not be the best choice for your professional website, it meets all the premises for an efficient program—and is a joy to create with!</p>
<h2 id="yeahbutwhataboutus">Yeah, but what about us?</h2>
<p>So what if there was a music notation program that fulfilled the four premises of computer philosophy? What would it look like? What restrictions, or “chains of freedom,” as Stravinsky put it, would it have?</p>
<p>If we want to satisfy the keyboard-centric premise, we need to invent our own language. Don’t worry, it doesn’t have to be rocket science—and in fact, a good program would employ shorthand we musicians are already familiar with.</p>
<p>When I say C4, you recognize it as middle C. Now, why can’t we use that shorthand to “write out” notes, like a word processor? Add a character to represent the duration (8=eighth note, 4=quarter note), and we’ve defined the note completely. Here’s Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, Mov. 4 theme written out this way (bar symbols added for clarity):</p>
<pre><code>| F#44 F#44 G44 A44 | A44 G44 F#44 E44 |
| D44 D44 E44 F#44 | F#44 E44 E42 |
| F#44 F#44 G44 A44 | A44 G44 F#44 E44 |
| D44 D44 E44 F#44 | E44 D44 D42 |
</code></pre>
<p>From here we can add other markings—articulations, expressive text, meter changes—that are linked to this string of notes. Here are just a couple ideas below:</p>
<pre><code>(4/4)| F#44 F#44 G44 A44 | A44 G44 F#44 E44 |
| *D44 D44 E44 F#44* | F#44 E44 E42 (2/2)|
| F#44 F#44 G44 A44 | A44 G44 F#44 E44 |
| D44 D44 E44 F#44 | E44 D44 D42 |
</code></pre>
<p>Notice I defined the first phrase as 4/4 time, and the second as 2/2. For expressive text, I can insert a little “bubble” (not shown in the example) that expands into its own text field, which keeps the notes in focus. Finally, I used asterisks to represent staccato. (I could have put a staccato behind every note, but I chose instead to surround the four notes with two asterisks to avoid redundancy.)</p>
<p>Obviously, a workflow like this could benefit from <strong>syntax highlighting</strong> (that’s when the program recognizes special symbols that affect your text and highlights it for easier reading), but can you see the possibilities of a language? And what if it was universally accepted by the notation software industry? I wouldn’t be praying for the death of my computer every time I opened a Finale document in Sibelius (or vice-versa).</p>
<p>This universal language idea also bleeds into the user-computer premise. After all, when we restrict ourselves to characters and let the computer handle the pixel-perfect result, the roles of creativity and automation are properly delegated. The challenge to developers following this premise is that the software’s notation logic must be better than it is right now (i.e. collisions, chord accidental placement) for the workflow to be optimal. And there are <a href="http://blog.steinberg.net/2014/03/development-diary-part-six/" title="Daniel Spreadbury's Blog">people working on just that</a>. But it wouldn’t hurt for the program to allow <em>limited</em> touch-ups on the preview end, because no program is perfect.</p>
<p>The third premise of self-sufficiency may be the hardest for us composers to accept, but can you imagine how freeing it would be to have the same workflow regardless of location? This is a philosophy under which the remote world<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> has thrived.</p>
<p>The fourth premise—a distraction and context-switch free workflow—would remove the tool palettes and icons that clutter up the screen in favor of keyboard shortcuts, and would put our content in focus. The reduction of buttons would reduce workflow interruptions and keep the artist inspired in the moment, though this forces the composer to thoroughly assimilate the language to work <em>fluently.</em> Still, the learning curve would be a fraction of the time it takes to learn today’s Big Boy notation programs.</p>
<h2 id="reallifeexamples">Real-Life Examples</h2>
<p>Are there any notation softwares currently vying to become <strong>The Perfect Program?</strong> I’m glad you asked.</p>
<p>There is an open source project called <a href="http://www.lilypond.org/" title="LilyPond">LilyPond</a>, which turns your code into an engraved score. The logic that handles the engraving is <em>purty darn good!</em></p>
<p><img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2016/02/LilyPond-1.png" alt="What's Wrong With Notation Software? And How To Fix It."></p>
<p>LilyPond isn’t all diamonds and flowers—the language is probably more complex than your average composer is willing learn. The built-in UI is not the prettiest, but with some customization you can hook up a pretty text editor (like <a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom">Atom</a>) and download the package “AtLilyPond” to get syntax highlighting. (I know that made no sense whatsoever…<a href="mailto:me@manuscriptmastr.com" title="Joshua Martin's email">email me</a> and I’ll explain it in English.) Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2016/02/Atom-Skim-1.png" alt="What's Wrong With Notation Software? And How To Fix It."></p>
<p>I’ve been toying around with it a bit, and while it’s not the easiest program to learn, it carries huge potential. I’d encourage you to try it out and see if it’s the dream you were looking for.</p>
<h2 id="letsdothis">Let’s Do This!</h2>
<p>All these words (gobble gobble gobble…), and what am I saying? Music notation has come a long way in the digital world, but our click-and-drag workflow doesn’t suit the creative process on a computer.</p>
<p>We need a notation program with a short learning curve that encourages clean data, cross-platform compatibility, and brilliant automation. We need a program that leverages the computer’s greatest strength: its keyboard. We need a program that lets us create and the computer automate. We need a program that works just as well on the road as it does in our home office. We need a program that puts our content first and doesn’t distract us with feature fanfare.</p>
<p><em><strong>We need a program that is idiomatic.</strong></em></p>
<p>Phew! We have covered a lot of ground on a scary subject—and just for the record, I’m still afraid of the programming workflow. The only times I’ve touched Terminal, GitHub, or Atom were under the thumb of a developer-brother eager to get me hooked on programming. I’m no coding geek. But I’m no longer afraid to learn lessons from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8" title="Imperial March">Dark Side</a>.</p>
<p>And you don’t have to be either.</p>
<p><strong>It’s time we took a cue from the people who really know how to work with a computer.</strong></p>

<h2 id="ii">II.</h2>
<p>Paul’s red pickup truck finally gained an inch—he could almost open the window and touch the fat blue line. He resisted the urge. “No doubt thirteen million other visitors have also put their hands all over it,” he muttered sharply, “and didn’t wash them.”</p>
<p>Paul’s front tires now sat on New York territory, but from the dashboard and back, his truck was in New Jersey. In thirty seconds his cup holder might be in a different state. And to think...at any moment, ninety feet of seawater could flood this tunnel. It would only take a leak, a bomb, an earthquake.</p>
<p>An act of God.</p>
<p><em>It could be worse,</em> Paul reminded himself, <em>if I hadn’t traded in the hearse.</em> A hearse under ninety feet of seawater would have been a dinner invitation to Lord Grim. Paul was not afraid of death: he knew well the fragility of life, and he had performed so many funerals in his lifetime that he felt his own death would be a mere formality. But nothing upset his stomach so much as the thought of drowning…except over-steeped coffee.</p>
<p>A tunnel and two hours later, the red pickup finally pulled beside a cross brick complex—six stories crawling with zig-zagging, ghastly black staircases. More than one step was missing. From the third landing hung a pale white banner: “Apartments for Rent.” Below it was a “No Parking” sign. <em>Rules are for keeping,</em> a stern, motherly voice barked inside Paul’s head. He continued driving down the block.</p>
<p>Paul remembered how Steven made a habit of taking down signs. “No parking?” Steven had pouted one day as they both drove up to theater. “Give me a second while I fix that…” and he unscrewed the sign with the most abominable smirk, then threw it into the trunk. Paul still kept that sign.</p>
<p>He continued five or six blocks down the one-way street before taking a left, then another left to investigate the complexes from behind. All the parking spaces were filled. “How do people live here?” he huffed. After about ten minutes of circling the complex, he stopped again in front of the rude sign. He thought for a minute, pulled onto the sidewalk, and thoughtlessly locked up the pickup’s exposed trunk.</p>
<p>“I’d like an apartment, single occupancy,” Paul announced as he opened the door into a cramped office. A young fellow—barely twenty—sat behind the counter. He didn’t blink or stir at Paul’s entrance. The guy was apparently hankering for some caffeine. Paul harrumphed and he nearly jumped onto the counter.</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, sure…um…let me find the forms,” the startled man nearly shouted. His mannerisms matched his oily crop of disheveled hair. He turned from Paul to the bar behind him and threw a glissando of papers into the air. “Um, listen…” he droned without turning back, “why don’t you check out the place while I…uh…” he made a frantic gesture to the corner, where Paul espied a teenager, younger than the guy behind the counter. He had not noticed him there till now. “Yes sir,” the boy hailed Paul with an unusually grownup tone, “I’d be happy to take your bag and show you a room. Follow me.” The doorman reached for Paul’s briefcase, but Paul clenched it tightly and offered him a handshake; the lad shook it heartily. <em>This guy actually knows how to give a good one,</em> Paul thought approvingly.</p>
<p>Out the door and up the black staircase the two ascended—one of the loose steps shivered under Paul’s weight. The apartment was on the second floor. <em>Is the second floor too boring?</em> Paul dismissed the notion: the sixth floor was horribly impractical. He sucked his teeth. “Is there one available on the third floor?”</p>
<p>“This is the only single we have available right now,” said the doorman as he jiggled the key around in the lock. “Is that alright?”</p>
<p>“It’ll do,” Paul shrugged.</p>
<p>The door required some prodding, and with a thrilling squeak it opened before them. The doorman shifted to the side; Paul strode across the threshold and stopped. He scanned the room with a cold glance: aged brick walls, streaky wood flooring, a metal duct that would give a basketball player a concussion, and a beamed ceiling. There was a single window to the right of the door and a crude desk with a couple ink marks. No bed, but that was to be expected. The bathroom vanity at the far end of the apartment looked decent, though the mirror above it was a little rotted around the edges.</p>
<p>“How do you like it, sir?” ventured the doorman, stealing a glimpse of Paul’s face.</p>
<p>“Hmmm…” Paul chewed his lips slightly and chilled his gaze even more; perhaps the ‘professor face’ would reduce his rent. After an exacting twelve seconds, he turned to the doorman, who appeared entirely unphased by his act.</p>
<p>“We do have some doubles available, if you’d like something more spacious.”</p>
<p>“Nah, this is fine,” said Paul as he retreated behind the threshold to the stairs. “I suppose your boss is done throwing papers around?”</p>
<p>The papers signed downstairs, Paul headed outside toward the pickup, with the lad following closely.</p>
<p>“Is this your car, Mr. Herbert?” the boy asked.</p>
<p>“Um…no,” Paul smoothly answered. “Taxi driver’s. I think he’s getting something to eat. He did leave me the keys so I could unpack.”</p>
<p>“Well, I hope he’s back soon. My boss—supervisor—might have a nervous breakdown if he sees someone parked on the sidewalk.”</p>
<p>“I’ll let him know.” Paul thrust in his key and popped the trunk open. “Everything should be in here…can you give me a hand?”</p>
<p>Paul looked back at the doorman’s face, which had completely altered: his vigorous, professional countenance had all but slinked down through the sewer grate. His pupils were cemented on the coffin in the trunk.</p>
<p>“It’s my clothes chest,” said Paul. “Alright…here, grab this side and I’ll hold from back here.” The doorman stretched out a single hand and delicately fingered the handle, then suddenly drew it back to scratch his nose.</p>
<p>“You’re going to need both hands for it. Solid wood.”</p>
<p>“Sorry—allergies, sir…no problem.”</p>
<p>It was feisty business getting up a metal flight with loose steps, but even more so because Paul seemed to be carrying most of the coffin’s weight. “Right here is fine,” he pointed at the wall opposite the desk, “gently, please.” The boy rather <em>dropped</em> the coffin on the floor. Paul slapped his hands on his shirt and immediately fell to writing at the desk; the doorman did not leave, and instead parked by the entrance with a transfixed expression. <em>I suppose they do tipping here?</em> Paul thought. The boy was still staring at the coffin.</p>
<p>“Here, I’ll prove it to you,” said Paul with some aggravation while unlocking the hinge, revealing a mess of hastily folded clothes, some bath accessories, and an old French press. “See,” he gestured, “no corpse. It was made for my grandmother, but she didn’t quite fit when they tried it.” Paul let out a nostalgic laugh (and didn’t mind). At this the boy’s eyes grew wide, and with a jolt he quitted the room.</p>
<p>“And I thought it was a pretty good joke,” Paul chuckled to himself as he scribbled away. “What? no pencil sharpener? Bother. Better see if Mr. Flying-Papers has one.”</p>
<p>Paul nearly tripped down the black stairs and thrust the door open into the office, the speed of which alarmed the “Boss.” The lad was in his customary corner and had reflexively snapped his mouth shut. Paul didn’t care that he was interrupting something.</p>
<p>“Do you have a pencil sharpener?”</p>
<p>“Sharpener? Um…nooo, but there is an office supply. Couple blocks from here, I’d say.” The Boss addressed Paul but was awkwardly looking <em>past</em> him. “Is...is that your car out there?”</p>
<p>“—Taxi driver’s,” the doorman exploded.</p>
<p>“He can’t park on the sidewalk like that!” the Boss gasped. “Where did I put that tower’s number?”</p>
<p>“Yah—” Paul stammered “—well, maybe he had a drink, or two. I can take the car to him...he left me the keys.”</p>
<p>“Will you be okay?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Paul whistled and slapped the air, “I handle people all the time.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t help smirking as he hopped into the pickup. Then he suddenly groaned.</p>
<p>“Good grief! I’ve got to buy a mattress. Now how am I going to get it up there without those two seeing my car? I can’t drag that thing up those stairs by myself. Bother!”</p>

<h2 id="i">I.</h2>
<p>“Listen you snapping otter, can’t you seen I’ve got a dead body to deliver?!” Paul croaked impatiently at the young man in front of him, who was attired sleekly in a black suit and white razored jaw. The man’s glossy black hair produced a nearly aquatic appearance.</p>
<p>“Ha ha, that’s a good one,” the man laughed nervously, then cut short, seeing that Paul did not approve of laughter. “So can I count on your support?”</p>
<p>“As much as you could count on me pulling you up a cliff. Fine, give me the pen.” The man handed Paul a scrawny notepad, seared in a couple places from the cigarette butts of less enthusiastic prospects. Paul jotted down a few scribbles and thrust the notepad back.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much sir, it’s really been a—”</p>
<p>A gruff “Good day” was all Paul said as he slammed the door shut. He took a long pause, then punctuated it with a deep groan: he had just given the sales rep his good pen. He would have given up his tie bar too if he could have five minutes of uninterrupted silence. A vintage car horn postponed that bargain. “I declare,” he hissed while taking a step back from the door, “that woman is the most impatient nag—”</p>
<p>There was a shattering sound and a dull thud, and now Paul was lying on his back staring at the ceiling. His forehead was wet. Presently he lifted his head up to see what his left foot had tripped on.</p>
<p>The article was a long wooden piece of furniture, similar to a trunk but shorter and lankier, about the size of a full-grown man. A clear liquid trickled down its hinges and was puddling on the carpet. Paul took a handkerchief from his coat pocket and wiped the water from his face.</p>
<p>By now his assistant had heard the accident and come to his side. “You alright, Herbert?” he asked with an outstretched hand. Paul only muttered something and pulled himself up.</p>
<p>“Bother, I upset the flowers. Well Scott, let’s get this guy into the car before his mother expires too. I’ve had enough services for one week.”</p>
<p>Snatching up the lily bouquet with one hand, Paul grabbed the coffin handle while his assistant lifted from the opposite side. They carried it out to the company hearse and shoved it into the trunk; the car was a Cadillac combination car, which doubled as Paul’s commuter.</p>
<p>“Go ahead and start the car.” Paul stepped back inside and tidied up the broken glass, then closed the front door behind him. Pulling out a ring of keys, he locked the door and was about to fasten the deadbolt. “Bother!” he muttered. It had never occurred to him before why anyone would <em>want</em> to break into a funeral home. <em>Better to lock up, than to save up!</em> rang his mother’s words; it didn’t matter to her whether the item was a house, a bike, or a cappuccino. But it couldn’t apply to a funeral home. One only locks up things they want, and Paul did not want it.</p>
<p>Still, the deadbolt was locked.</p>
<p>Down the ugly street the hearse drove—Paul had named this one-lane road himself: Paulbearer Street. <em>What if I had named it something like Pallflower Way or Death Row?</em> his mind wandered, but suddenly he clenched his eyes and shook his head: such names were entirely unsuitable and impractical.</p>
<p>An old woman checking the mail raised her hand to greet his passing hearse, but her face was expressionless and pallid as a full moon. Not till Paul waved back did she remember to smile.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s getting to be <em>her</em> time,” Scott the assistant quipped from the passenger seat. Paul nearly laughed, but only frowned. What woman would know how to hail two men in a hearse?</p>
<p>A couple blocks down Main Street brought them to the town cemetery. The mother of the deceased was already far off at the gravesite, hugging a box of tissues like it was a gold nugget and the birds above were greedy prospectors.</p>
<p>Paul pulled up to the curb as a hefty figure in muddy trousers approached his trunk. “You need help here?” the man asked.</p>
<p>“Hello William. Yes, if it’s not too much trouble—I think I’ve thrown out my back, so I’d rather not strain it more.”</p>
<p>“Sure.” The man William threw down his spade and heaved open the trunk. To Paul’s surprise, he took the coffin up into his arms without Scott’s help at all, then half-tossed it to adjust his grip.</p>
<p>“Please be careful, his mother—” Scott began to plead.</p>
<p>“He’s dead. People like that don’t mind if you throw them around a little,” William grinned darkly then spit on the sidewalk. Paul did not like the man’s stingy remark or his grin.</p>
<p>“Oh—I don’t remember your name—” the man nodded to Paul “—grab my shovel, will you?”</p>
<p>“It’s Paul,” Paul said impatiently.</p>
<p>“Sorry. For the life of me…I know I’ve seen you somewhere. You work at…that funeral home, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and I’m here twice a week,” Paul muttered with an indistinct growl. Not even a gravedigger remembered him. He salved his aggravation with the thought of an early dinner.</p>
<p>The body delivered, Paul drove on to the outskirts of Woodstock. He puttered through the quaint little neighborhood to its only cul-de-sac. As he made a sharp left turn onto the crumbling driveway, his suddenly caught sight of a dark object.</p>
<p>A black cat crouching in the precise middle of his driveway. As Paul’s car neared, it stiffened into a more erect pose, those keen eyes fastened on him. He cautiously inched the car up to it, but the cat would not budge. Paul’s ear twitched. He climbed out of the hearse and stooped over the ominous creature, whose unblinking stare fixed upon Death’s personal chariot. The voracious lime eyes turned upward to him. Paul shrugged, backed off a foot, then kicked “kitty” out of the way.</p>
<p>The house was a fit companion for superstition—Paul hardly kept it in order. He had seen clean houses make nothings of old single men. It was two stories, with all the furniture upstairs in the bedroom or the office. (The office doubled as the kitchen.) “It doesn’t make sense to spread your stuff around when you only use two rooms,” Paul had reasoned when he first moved into the house.</p>
<p>Without changing out of his suit, he fell to writing at the desk while the kettle heated up his water. He scribbled out a flurry of musical notes. Sharps, time signatures, bar lines, written instructions, 8va brackets. 15va for the piccolo. Should the 1st violin double the flute, or would a solo oboe be the best color in that range? Liquid and transparent is what he wanted. Better double the flute with an oboe. Pianissimo timpani roll at measure 265, and perhaps triangle on beat 3? No, too much ornamentation. Clean and simple speaks best.</p>
<p>Paul knew his writing was hardly legible, the parts barely playable. Music was the wildcard in his reasonable life, the scratched-up window into his soul. It was the only regular practice of his that did not subscribe to habit, but frenzy.</p>
<p>“Bother, water’s cold already,” Paul suddenly looked up from the desk. An entire hour had passed, and before him were two sheets of manuscript burrowed and smudged through with illegible jots, shapes and lines. Beethoven himself couldn’t read it. But after Paul had reheated his water and sipped his cappuccino, his eyes again surveyed the lifeless ink blobs. There might be genius in them after all. He closed his eyes and began to hum. The lips wrinkled, the forehead curdled while some magical thought whirred through his brain.</p>
<p>“Stop it Paul,” he spouted and unclenched his eyes, “you’re only dreaming.” Paul pulled out a blank sheet of paper and fell to writing something else.</p>
<p>But the thought had once for all pinned itself to his fancies.</p>

Don’t worry, just back up to <a href="http://manuscriptmastr.com/the-glass-lady-pt-2/" title="The Glass Lady, Pt. 2">Part 2</a> (or <a href="http://manuscriptmastr.com/the-glass-lady-pt-1/" title="The Glass Lady, Pt. 1">Part 1</a> if you’re really behind!).</em></p>
<h2 id="iii">III.</h2>
<p>Early the next morning the glassblower’s trial began while the entire city whooped and sneered outside on the courthouse steps. The Lady had not yet returned. A witness testified falsely that the glass blower’s “little witch of an apprentice” had waved a wand to cause the vessel to disintegrate, while another swore he had chanted a spell. These and similar testimonies were heard in the court for hours, only broken by the midday meal. Still the man waited for the Lady before presenting his defense, but at the end of the day no one had come, and the court convened for the day.</p>
<p>Another day of trial passed, filled with derisive attacks pronouncing him a proud, seducing man who was possessed by the Devil. Four days he stood trial, the unwilling subject of scorn’s tongue; each night he was again thrown into his cell, and the Lady had not come.</p>
<p>The fifth and final day of the trial was in session; already the jury had condemned him. The impassioned words of the lying witnesses had swayed the public against him. Knowing that the judge—a greedy man eager to tax his business—would condemn him apart from the apprentice’s testimony, the glass blower suddenly spoke.</p>
<p>“Honorable judge and distinguished members of this assembly, hear me. While these witnesses have brought forth nothing but slanderous and inconsistent testimonies of my work, I have said nothing. I declare that I am innocent of their charges, and that there is no evil craft—neither sorcery, witchcraft, or devilish possession—in my methods. To prove such, I propose that you observe with your own eyes how I strengthen my creations. Bring me sand and the instruments of glassmaking.”</p>
<p>After some errand boys had fetched his instruments, he demonstrated before the court how he hardened his glass by heating and rapidly cooling it, which gave it resilience many times greater than regular glass. When he had concluded he took the judge’s gavel and hit it forcefully. To the court’s amazement the gavel bounced harmlessly off the glass; not the faintest crack was present in its form. Though partly satisfied with his demonstration, the court demanded an explanation of the boat’s shattering; for despite the witnesses’ inconsistencies, they all agreed it had simply vanished into thin air rather than breaking into visible shards.</p>
<p>As the glass blower had never attempted to break his creations he could not explain it, so he raised the gavel high to break his demonstration; but however hard he tried, he could not break the glass he had tempered before the court. Several times he smote it with heavy blows, but still the glass was unsullied. He grew nervous, for he knew the only way to prove his innocence was to destroy a tempered work, but the only other works he had tempered were his three (now two) masterworks. He bided his time for the Lady, hoping she would bring the apprentice before he destroyed the second of his greatest achievements; but after several hours of delay she did not come. The court would sentence him to the death of a sorcerer if he did nothing.</p>
<p>With trembling he requested to take them to his glass windmill (which they granted). He approached his masterpiece, hammer in hand. There immediately before him was a solid glass wall, whose every detail and imperfection was memorized by his sharp eye. After drawing a long breath he aimed the head at the wall to slay it, then struck it as a blacksmith hammers a sword. The hammer rebounded from the wall, impenetrable save a faint scuff. The walls of his masterpiece too were indestructible. He climbed up into the windmill and furiously hammered every surface he passed. By now the crowd was murmuring anxiously, and even a jury member whispered to the judge, “Let’s head back and have it over with!”</p>
<p>His frustration somewhat abated, the glass blower climbed out to the lower balcony that wrapped around the windmill’s base; he recalled from the reports how his apprentice had inadvertently shattered the boat by hitting the handrail. This balcony likewise was lined with ornate, delicate handrails—strong enough to lean against, but not enough perhaps to withstand a blow. He hammered it, and suddenly felt the entire floor give beneath him. The assembly below him broke his fall as the entire windmill dissolved into a cloud of glass dust.</p>
<p>With this final proof the members returned to the courthouse and were obliged to acquit him of the charges, and he was dismissed; but the frenzied mob outside the doors received him and mercilessly beat him, unchallenged by authorities. Thus satisfied with their transgression the crowd dispersed, leaving the mauled figure upon the steps of the court.</p>
<p>Later the Lady arrived (without the apprentice); her heart was grieved at the sight, and she wept long over his lifeless body. As she lamented, her immortality left her, and she collected her tears in a blue vial. Then, seeing tears of blood descend from the man’s senseless eyes, she mingled them with her own tears in a red vial.</p>
<p>The Lady bore the body away in her carriage to the man’s childhood home by the sea, where she and the town buried and mourned him. As an abiding emblem of her love for him, she forged wind chimes with the blue and red vials and installed them in the villa square. To the end of her mortal life she remained a widow, living alone until she was finally swept away in a pandemic.”</p>
<hr>
<p>“That’s a sad story,” said the boy after the old woman had finished her tale. “How did you come by the chimes, then?”</p>
<p>“Well, I was told that after the Lady’s death the apprentice returned to the city of his master’s death. He claimed the glass house as rightfully his and later bartered for the wind chimes to display in the front yard.”</p>
<p>“How could he do such a thing?”</p>
<p>“True, his wicked intentions cannot be excused; but in a way he preserved his master’s work from desecration—not only did he maintain the house but he also designed the grounds that you have beautifully tended.”</p>
<p>“So this is the very house the glass blower built! How came you by it?”</p>
<p>“As I understand, the great city fell into depression shortly after he acquired the house, and he was forced to sell it to the city. The depression meanwhile continued to worsen and starvation set in—some saw it as judgment on the city for murdering an innocent man. After some time the city finally consented to auction off this house, and at that time I was well off financially. But now that my fortune has taken wing…” she laughed grimly.</p>
<p>“Did the Lady ever give her account to God of how she spent her heart?”</p>
<p>“Well, nothing is certain until we join her and the man in Heaven, but I have a happy ending of my own to add to the story.”</p>
<p>“When the Lady passed away, she appeared before the Father in Heaven and pleaded to marry the glass blower. Now we know from our Blessed Savior that humanity is not given in marriage after death, but I think the Father made an exception because of the potency of her love. And thus the man and Lady were truly joined together in the sight of God, as it were. But after the wedding the Lady was still remorseful about the green vial that her husband had broken when he was thrown into prison. The Father, perceiving her distress, reproduced it for her. “Why My daughter,” He said, “it has been here all along!” Thus heartened, she showed Him her chest of vials, full of tears spent on others and twice spent on her husband. Looking through her chest, the Father inquired about her musical studies on earth. “What did you learn of music while among My Creation?” “Oh,” cried the Lady like a little child, “it was all wonderful to hear, though You were right that pain and suffering accompanied it. I loved the lyre and harp and tambourine, and the human voice—but alas! I have no talent for making music myself. I am afraid I have no music to make unto You.”</p>
<p>“Why,” laughed the Father, “you did make music unto Me! Follow Me, and bring your chest.”</p>
<p>He brought the Lady to a creek just outside the Heavenly City. She remembered the place, for she had often swum into the City from this bank. The Father took the first vial from her chest, pulled out its stopper, and poured a single tear into the creek. It produced a beautiful warble. He continued to empty the vial until an entire melody effervesced from the water, then altered noticeablely as it repeated. In this manner He emptied all her vials, until the creek was filled with such a counterpoint as could never be conceived by man: a symphony of glorious proportion that ever changed as the invisible tears clinked with each other like little chimes. Presently the Lady realized that the sounds were flowing down into the City itself. From there they dispersed into the great Rivers, so that all regions quit the lonely silence, and through her tears music was made in Heaven. Thus fulfilled were the words of the Beloved Psalmist: ‘There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.’”</p>
<p>“That is what I like to think happened at least,” winked the old lady. “Now do you like the tale better?”</p>
<p>“Very much! It’s better with your ending. Would you tell me another story? They are so lovely.”</p>
<p>“Dear boy you flatter me! There is one actually I have not told in a long time…it concerns a father and his two children. One of them was actually the son of his brother, who had…”</p>
<p>The boy fell asleep in her couch before she had gotten far in her tale, but when next he awoke it was daylight. The curtains were drawn back and the house in order. The chair where the lady had told her tales was in the same spot it was the night before. And on the table was a sumptuous meal, far more splendid than what the lady normally prepared. There was however only one set of dishes set out; he guessed that perhaps she left early to run an errand. But she had trouble getting around, he remembered. He thought to see whether she was sewing in one of the other rooms, but he had forgotten that the wind chimes were still on his lap. As he got up they began to fall to the floor, and instinctively he reached out to break its fall!</p>
<p>The townspeople had meanwhile become troubled concerning the boy’s absence, for he no longer made trips to their houses. A spontaneous assembly followed, during which some claimed he had ventured to the glass house. “What! The poor boy!” cried a mother with two children clutching at her dress. “He long tended my younglings. What is to be done? Who will come to his rescue?” “Not I,” replied a hard-eyed spinster. “Yes, ‘poor boy!’ but death and thieving happen every day, and how should we manage if we attended every misfortune? Besides, the house is enchanted.”</p>
<p>“You gossiping fools!” cried a gruff old man. “Have you forgotten that it was injustice all along which has since plundered our city? If the boy is in distress, we must come to his aid!”</p>
<p>With one accord the entire village marched up to the house (trampling the garden) with clubs and sickles. Several put their ears to the glass door and heard a perplexing mixture of crying and singing. “Whose voice is that?” said one, “for it sounds more beautiful than the choir.” “It must be that wicked man putting a spell on the poor lad,” replied the other. “Nay! but could such a voice be of evil?” They gave a tremendous shove on the door, which to their surprise was unlocked.</p>
<p>There before them on the floor was the boy by himself. There was no evil man beside him, though the boy was crying and his hands were red as if bleeding. But he was also singing, very softly, with an almost angelic quality. One could not tell from this paradoxical sight whether the boy was in pain or euphoria.</p>
<p>While the crowd stood aloof outside the “enchanted” house, one bright-eyed girl stepped toward him. She saw that the boy’s hands were not bleeding, nor was he in pain; for beside him were the wind chimes, missing a vial, and in his little white hands shards of red glass shimmered like the jewels that crown a celestial stream. The boy finally looked up, his face graced with wet cheeks and the largest smile he could make. He motioned for her to come closer then softly whispered in her ear while her eyes grew even brighter.</p>
<p>But of the wonderful secrets he told her in that moment, all she remembered was this: <em>For no one may break the vial except he who who caused the tears…</em></p>

Grab a marshmallow and back up to <a href="http://manuscriptmastr.com/the-glass-lady-pt-1/" title="The Glass Lady, Pt. 1">Part 1</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="ii">II.</h2>
<p>The boy was captivated by the Lady and would often ask her silly questions while she worked at her crafts. One day she showed him different ways to shape molten glass by rolling it on a metal surface. “It’s called <em>marvering,”</em> she explained. “We roll the glass along the table to make the sides even as we shape it.”</p>
<p>The boy did not reply, for he was absorbed in thought. “Is something troubling you?” she asked. The boy suddenly straightened up and asked her, “Are you an angel?” She did not grimace at the boy’s blunt question. “No,” she said, “though I have lived with them as a youth. The Father has made me a little lower than them and a little higher than man.” The Lady’s answer was sensible to the young lad, and after his artless interrogation he badgered her to help him make a set of glass bowls for his family.</p>
<p>But having thought over her answer one night, he could not help wondering what a Lady from Heaven would be doing on the earth. He saw her singing outside the old church one Sabbath. “Why are you singing when you sound so bad?” he asked in his plain manner. The Lady laughed and replied, “Like all who love God, I sing to make my Father happy. It was the reason I came to earth—to make music for Him.”</p>
<p>The boy was puzzled. “But why would you come to the earth to sing where He cannot hear you? Why would you abandon Heaven for a place where people starve and are rude to each other?”</p>
<p>The Lady paused thoughtfully. “Well, dear one, you must know that before I came here I had not heard music.”</p>
<p>“There’s no music in Heaven?”</p>
<p>“No…at least not now. Ever since Lucifer the Music Master was thrown down, no music has been heard in the Heavenly realms. I was born long after his overthrow. I remember the Father asking me one day what I thought of His kingdom. “Oh, all Your works are lovely!” said I, “and there is nothing more beautiful than Your City, but…I have always longed to hear music, even just a little, as in the days before the Enemy was thrown down.” Said the Father, “It grieves Me to have lost his music too; perhaps you may amend the silence. How would you like to learn to <em>make</em> music, my child? There is so much music on earth, though pain and suffering accompany it.” This proposition excited me greatly, and to that end I have come here. And yet…” the Lady blushed, “I seem to have no faculty for it, as you perceive. Still, I have been able to hear many wonderful musicians during my travels.” Before the Lady could continue the boy’s mother called him away.</p>
<p>Having shown the villagers how to turn the humble presents of nature into beautiful works of art, the Lady helped them establish trade with the neighboring villages; most of the villagers by now had given up gathering altogether, since food was delivered from regions of more abundance. The poor slum had become a thriving center for business.</p>
<p>The boy especially excelled in glassmaking and spent most of his time creating pieces to put on the trading wagons. One night in particular he crafted a vase to give to the Lady; far into the early morning he worked, and after a deep slumber he was awoken by his mother. “It’s very late, my son! You had better hurry to the square if you are going to catch the lesson.” The boy threw on his clothes and bolted out the door with his present wrapped in tree bark. The sun was nearly atop the village, and he could see the assembly silently gathered around the square.</p>
<p>The boy planned to present his gift to the Lady immediately, and so made his way through the crowd to the center of the square; but the Lady was not there, nor had anyone seen her yet. While he mused over her absence, he heard above him the telltale rattling sound from the mountain overlooking the village.</p>
<p>He immediately darted from the square to the mountain road. The carriage was long up the lane and seemed to quicken its pace at his chase. With doubled determination he pursued and ascended the mountain, slowly gaining on it; but when he had come within shouting distance, he tripped over a stone and fell on his little chest. He heard the carriage stop and shoes softly patter toward him—the Lady had seen him fall. She helped him up, and thankfully he was only a little bruised; but the vase he made had collapsed under his weight.</p>
<p>The Lady wiped the dirt from his face while he sobbed wildly. “What’s wrong, dearest?” she asked soothingly while kissing his forehead. His voice only broke into another cry, but when he had finally calmed down he asked, “Do you not love me enough to stay?” He pled with her again and again not to leave. The Lady did not answer him, but embraced him tightly and wiped away his tears; she shed tears herself. But instead of wiping hers away, she produced a bright green glass vial and put it against her cheek to let the tears fall into it; she sealed the vial with a stopper and gave it to the boy.</p>
<p>“When men shed tears,” she explained to him, “the Father wipes them away; but He has charged me to collect my tears in glass vials as an account of how I spent my heart. I am forbidden to spend them on myself, but I may on others. When loneliness sojourns your heart and grief is nigh, look upon this vial I have given you and remember my love. And when the darkest moments of life blind your way, open the vial and pour a single drop upon the floor. I will come to you wherever you may be. Be careful with the vial, for no one may break it except the one who caused the tears, and it must be preserved for when I return to my Father for accounts. I cannot cry over you again and make you another vial, for then I should become mortal.” With one last embrace she returned to her carriage and ascended the mountain.</p>
<p>The next day he awoke to the sound of rattling and ran outdoors. “It’s the Glass Lady!” he cried, only to startle a stranger who was inquiring about the inn. Many visitors now came to survey the town’s handiwork, but the Lady was never among them.</p>
<p>Years passed by, and the boy grew into a handsome young man. He became greatly renowned for his work with glass, and faithfully he preserved the Lady’s vial in his breast pocket—though the recollection of her gentility, patience, and industrious vigor had all but darkened in his memory. His insatiable appetite for wonder had drawn near those with like curiosity, and the contentment to illuminate wonder in others budded into the satisfaction of self-praise, and then that thorn, pride, which bruises all humanity.</p>
<p>The man became boastful of his accomplishments and belittled the poor, for none of his lowly past humbled him from atop the hollow wings of fame. He moved into the city and installed his workshop in its richest district next to the shore. To further build a name for himself, he fashioned three works of impossible strength: a glass windmill, a glass house, and a glass ship. These marvelous pieces attracted scores of inquisitive tourists and brought revelry and drunkenness to the city’s lodgings. While the inhabitants despised the commotion, those in the political circle saw the glassblower’s amusements as a profitable enterprise to tax.</p>
<p>Because of the many projects with which the glassblower was engaged, he hired on an apprentice to learn his trade and help him with his work. To his surprise the youth learned quickly, as he had long ago; the boy excelled in everything his master taught. So impressed was his master that he kept nothing from him, even the secret to the strength of his three works.</p>
<p>It was evident that his apprentice’s diligence was educed by his supervisor’s masterworks, and after some persuasion the glass blower permitted him to oversee the attractions while he focused on other projects. The apprentice was elated and immediately began to oversee the business.</p>
<p>It happened that one day while the apprentice was taking a large group aboard the glass boat, he took guesses as to how the boat was made so strong. A variety of answers were given, both reasonable and ridiculous, and to each he nodded with a dry, provocative expression. Presently one irritated gentleman suddenly cried, “I am affronted by your audacity, young rascal. Do you take us for a crowd of silly spectators watching a magic show? If your boat is so strong, why don’t you hammer it and cease your boasting!”</p>
<p>The apprentice turned red and curled his lips; he did not want to appear the fool before his guests. He could not imagine that his master would make anything breakable, and so producing a mallet, struck the handrail of the boat. All at once the entire vessel disintegrated into a fine powder, and he and his guests plunged into the water. No one was injured, but after the incident word spread that the glassblower used sorcery to strengthen his glass, and that a simple command could undo it. Terrified of the trouble he had brought upon his master, the apprentice fled the city.</p>
<p>Soon the entire city was incited against the glassblower, and he was arrested (for sorcery and witchcraft were expressly forbidden in that region). He was led by guards to the city prison and thrown facedown into his cell. Getting onto his cot he instinctively felt his chest: the Lady’s green vial had shattered in his breast pocket. <em>Be careful not to break the vial,</em> he recalled, <em>for none except he who caused the tears may break it, and I cannot make you another one, else I shall become mortal.</em> Bitterly he remembered his humble past and saw how arrogance had sprung up in his heart. He remembered the Lady and her patient instruction; if not for her, he would have continued to be a poor gatherer. Once he had knocked over one of her creations, and yet she did not turn him away; and when she left she gave him her tears as proof of her love. Then he remembered the power of her tears—they were magical, he thought—what else had she instructed him that solemn day of her departure?</p>
<p>A wetness suddenly chilled him, for some of the tears from the broken vial had collected into the corner of his breast pocket. <em>Let but one drop fall upon the floor</em> he half-recited, then he squeezed the damp corner until a single drop swelled and fell to the floor.</p>
<p>Instantly the Lady herself appeared outside his cell. The man gaped dumbly at her appearance: she was the same lovely, ageless woman, but he was now a handsome man. But instead of reaching through the bars to embrace her, he hung his head low with mortification.</p>
<p>“Why sir,” she said with concern, “why are you so downcast?”</p>
<p>“I—” the man started but choked. “I…I did not mean to summon your presence, my Lady. That part of your instruction I forgot.”</p>
<p>“Did you call for me in error then?”</p>
<p>“No! for I am a man now in lowest states.”</p>
<p>“What do you wish for me to do?”</p>
<p>The man explained to her his misfortunes, not withholding the faults that had indirectly caused them. “Take me from this prison to which I am unlawfully confined, and restore my reputation which is lost.”</p>
<p>“Sir,” she laughed gravely, “Though I can no longer call you a ‘little one,’ I perceive that same guileless manner with which you addressed me all those years ago. That childish faith pleases me, but I do not have the authority to set a Paul or Silas free, nor to undo what mischief has done to your good name. I am but a <em>little</em> higher than man, not an angel.”</p>
<p>Though the man knew as much he was sorely dismayed at her answer.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless,” she continued, “if I can find your apprentice, his testimony could clear your name.”</p>
<p>The man agreed and sent the Lady off in search of the youth.</p>

<h2 id="i">I.</h2>
<p>On the outskirts of a poor village lived a young boy, who without parents or shelter was obliged to search for employment. Every day he made his way from door to door performing odd jobs; every night, exhausted from his work, the youth procured morsels from his earnings and fell asleep on a bed of rushes beside the road.</p>
<p>Most of the inhabitants lived in one-room thatched huts of wattle and daub (those deemed better off had two or three rooms at most), as no one could afford houses of brick. But there was one house, made entirely of glass, that overlooked the village. It was a curious spectacle opulently furnished with beds and tables and chairs. By day its curtains were drawn back to reveal the splendid appointments within, and by night closed fast to permit naught but the glow of candlelight.</p>
<p>The house’s reclusive owner no one had seen, but all the village’s parents had some mean tale concerning him to tell their wayward children (as did gossiping neighbors to their friends). Some said he was an old thief who, having pilfered the Sandman’s sand, melted it into glass to build his house in hopes of picking the pockets of unhappy souls who wandered in and fell asleep.</p>
<p>While the boy was much too frightened to knock on this man’s door for work, his reveries often turned to the subject of living indoors, and in a glass abode. He had once lived indoors, in a damp cellar. But to live in a glass house, he thought, ah!—to sleep in a dry feather bed and laugh at the rain and wind that lashed about harmlessly above an invisible roof—these and similar thoughts amused and vexed him. How insufferable it was to wake up to cold rain and a soaked rush-bed!</p>
<p>The garden in front of the house was a <em>jardin à la française,</em> rich with noble greens and dazzling whites and interspersed discriminately with jutting topiaries; in the center of the garden hung wind chimes, which were made of glass tubes filled with water to varying heights (thereby producing different pitches). The boy had never seen this ornament before or heard its music, and on windy days he found himself tarrying in front of it before making his rounds in the village.</p>
<p>The wind chimes seemed magical, for they produced such deftly improvised melodies that one could not help but sing to its rich counterpoint. The boy had long wished to sing with the village church choir, but the director would never admit him because of his shrill, unruly voice. These wind chimes, he thought, were even more beautiful than the choir, or the traveling bands that sometimes passed through, and by the chimes’ gentle instruction he strengthened his crude voice. Presently he felt that he too could improvise melodies as organically as the instrument of Chance, and he often sang softly during his errands in the village.</p>
<p>But several weeks later the boy noticed a change: the garden, always neatly kept, had begun to looked ragged. The hedges were becoming overgrown and weeds were springing up. Soon the rushes crept up into yard and choked out the wind chime’s music.</p>
<p>The boy felt sorry for the garden and the wind chimes, whose music had cheered his spirits. He was afraid of the mysterious owner, but he knew he should not meddle with his garden without first inquiring of him; after finishing his work one day, he approached the strange house (after hiding away his two coins under a rock) and knocked on its glass door. Through it he could not descry anything except the glow of candles.</p>
<p>“Sir, would you open the door?” he half-cried. There was no answer. “Please,” he continued, “I saw that your garden was overgrown, and I wondered if I could help?” He waited patiently for a few minutes, but still nothing stirred within. He turned to leave when suddenly the door opened, and the boy was startled to see the face of an old woman—hardly the dangerous man everyone spoke of. Her cheeks were glossy with tears.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” said the boy, embarrassed. “I didn’t mean to disturb you like this. I was just concerned about your garden.”</p>
<p>“Oh no my lad, it’s not your fault,” she said and cleared her throat. “You see, I was robbed about a month ago. Most of my money was taken, and until today I had hopes that I would be compensated for the loss, but alas! I don’t know how I shall manage.”</p>
<p>“Is that why the garden—”</p>
<p>“I can no longer afford anyone to maintain my garden,” she told him, “and who in this poor village would buy such an expensive house so I might put money aside for necessities?” She despaired that she could not hire him, and closing the door softly she left the lad in the waning light of dusk.</p>
<p>The boy felt compassion for the old lady. It occurred to him that while he was confined to poverty, she was trapped in a rich house that could not be traded for even the basics of life. It must be soon when the last of her money was spent, he thought.</p>
<p>That evening after eating his meager portion, the boy decided to take action. At nightfall while the old lady slept, he cleaned and trimmed the old woman’s garden—though he was already exhausted from his day’s work. Far into the night he labored, aided by the glow of candlelight, and when he had finished he lay down on the bed of clippings.</p>
<p>In the morning the old woman was astonished at the boy’s deed and called him into her house. She cried him mercy for selfishness: for though she had little money, she derived much of her sustenance from her garden which supplied her amply. Weakened by infirmity she could no longer tend its crop, but surely the boy could work it and share its produce in return. The boy agreed to this arrangement eagerly.</p>
<p>With the garden now providing his portion, the boy no longer needed to go into the village, and by and by the woman prevailed upon him to stay in her house rather than sleep on rushes. He loved his work tending the garden and singing with the wind chimes.</p>
<p>Like the garden the boy’s spirit and body grew under the old lady’s motherly affection, and on his birthday the woman gave him a present she had wrapped in some curtain fabric. As he pulled away the fabric his eyes widened with ecstasy.</p>
<p>“The wind chimes! Oh, they are beautiful! But can they possibly be for me?” He told her how much he loved listening to its music. “I can even sing like them…” Unabashedly he sang to her, and to his delight the old lady clapped approvingly rather than stopping her ears. “Goodness child, you sing just like a lark!” she cried. “Perhaps God may grant you a future in music—where did you learn to sing so?”</p>
<p>“It’s all because of these wind chimes,” replied the boy. “They have helped my voice by making such wonderful sounds I cannot help but sing with them. Did you make them?”</p>
<p>The old woman shook her head. “They were made long ago; I still recall the story of their making—though I leave it to you whether or not to believe it. It concerns another boy (about your age, I’d say). But it’s a long tale.” At this playful hint the boy curled up on the couch opposite her and closed his eyes.</p>
<hr>
<p>“The world might have deemed this boy poor by its standards, but he was certainly rich in the things that please the Father. From birth his bright eyes exuded wonder at every charm of nature and humanity, and that feature made him a quick learner. His village was poor like ours, and more so: most residents spent their days gathering food from the wild, rather than sewing curtains or tending gardens.” She winked at the boy.</p>
<p>“Now the village sat at the foot of a high mountain next to the shore, trapped between the sea and earth. And it happened one day as the boy was gathering wild roots beside the mountain road that he heard rattling wheels and espied a carriage descending the mountain road. As it neared him he saw that it was constructed of metal and ornately engraved about the doors. Its passenger was a fair, tall lady clad in a blue satin dress and christened with golden hair. Seeing him in the thicket, the lady hailed him and asked whether the village inn was near. The boy was so taken by her beauty that he dropped his roots and, motioning for her to follow, ran ahead of her toward the village (in spite of her entreaties to ride in her carriage).</p>
<p>The innkeeper was elated to have a guest in his sordid accommodation (which had been vacant for months), even more so when the Lady insisted on paying him more than the usual price. By evening the entire village was gossiping about their strange visitor.</p>
<p>The next day found the women and children gathering their baskets for the day’s work; the boy was among them. Walking past the public square he saw the Lady again, sitting on a little wooden stool with a briefcase at her side. His family urged him to move on, but instead he lingered behind and ran up to her.</p>
<p>“Hello,” he said sheepishly.</p>
<p>The Lady looked up from her work. “Well hello, little one. I thank you for helping me yesterday; it was a extraordinary gesture of you.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing sitting here?”</p>
<p>“Going about my work.”</p>
<p>“You work?” the boy asked curiously. He had never imagined that a woman with a carriage worked.</p>
<p>“Why of course! The Father made the body to work. Though not all bodies labor alike…” She pulled out some dried grasses from her case and began to weave them into a curious shape; she formed a sort of bowl and installed a handle that arched from either end; the boy instantly recognized it as a basket, like the one he used to gather food. Satisfied with her work she gave the basket to him.</p>
<p>“Come tomorrow and I will show you how to make other things with your hands,” the Lady said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think my mother will let me stay from the gathering,” the boy shrugged, “but I shall try.” At that moment his family entreated him to keep up with the group, and he bid the beautiful Lady farewell.</p>
<p>The next morning as the people mended their old baskets for gathering, the Lady again sat in the square. The boy was warned not to linger from work, and he went out with his family as usual. However, at the midday break he rushed back to the square to find a dozen neighbors around her, watching intently as she wove a basket far more elaborate than the one she had shone him the day before. He ran straight up to her.</p>
<p>“Hello little one,” she smiled.</p>
<p>“Hello,” he replied less sheepishly. “Can you show me the basket now?”</p>
<p>“Well I’m afraid I am in the middle of teaching your neighbors another kind, but afterward we shall work on the other one together.”</p>
<p>After she had finished her demonstration, she taught the boy how to make his first basket. The next day, he ran again to the square during his break. The Lady was teaching how to make soaps, which she said cleaned better than only water. The time passed quickly and he was later scolded for neglecting his work. Over the week the Lady’s crowd of pupils grew, until nearly half the village spent their break learning her crafts. Although his parents initially disapproved of the way she detained workers from gathering, they soon joined the boy in lessons and saw the usefulness of her handiwork.</p>
<p>The Lady’s favorite material to work with was glass—something the boy had never seen made. He was delighted at how sand from the seashore could be made into that clear, hard substance that favored richer dwellings. That a gentle lady could work with cruel heat and crude tools gave her a magical rapport with her watchers, and her animation for the art was such that they began to call her the “Glass Lady.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have an interview with his Angelicy Michael the Archangel,” I announce to the Keeper of the Gate. The gate is a tall, gilded portal—strong and impenetrable—cast from solid gold and installed on lofty hinges. Just up the hill beyond the gate I hear a gathering of angels laughing softly (almost musically): “I cannot understand the interpretive liberties these commentators take,” says one as he wags his head. “Indeed,” says another, “it is disappointing how often they reverse the intended meaning of our Master’s words.” I can hear many other conversations from within, for the air is acoustically resonant (as if the City’s architect intended there to be few secrets here).</p>
<p>“His Angelicy is removed to the Western reaches of the earth, and is unable to make his ordained meeting,” says the Gatekeeper. “I may however grant you an interview with His Holiness, the Almighty.”</p>
<p>“Is he not summoned to the National Day of Prayer Breakfast in ten minutes?”</p>
<p>“His Holiness attends many things at once, though we His agents cannot. If you wish for someone else, I can schedule you an appointment with Moses His Prophet.”</p>
<p>“But he is dead?”</p>
<p>“The Almighty Himself buried the Prophet, but that he has taken leave of your world favors your business here. I warn you however, he is prone to lengthy speech…”</p>
<p>“Then I shall take my business to His Holiness.”</p>
<p>“The Almighty will see you now; follow me.”</p>
<p>He opens the gate and motions for me to follow him up the hill. I notice that my guide has but one face, as I have heard that some angels have four faces. The lane I tread is inset with burning pearls which should blind the eye, but I imagine that blindness is forbidden within the City. A magnificent temple sits upon the hilltop, and from its white banners I hear the thundering of wings.</p>
<p>In the temple’s shadow I am admitted to the courtroom, then indoors to what they call the Holy Place, the main hall or lobby of the temple. Several narrow balconies wrap the hall’s perimeter at varying heights, though I see no stairs going to or from them. This place would be an elegant setting for an interview, but the angel now leads me through a corridor, between the torn remnants of a once richly crafted curtain. I wonder why they have not mended it, unless sentimentality fondles its presence? It is the first ragged sight I have seen in this lavish economy. As the angel is eager to press on, I must inquire concerning it later.</p>
<p>The inner room beyond the curtain is twice the size of the Holy Place, and it is no wonder that my guide calls it the Holiest Place. Holier must mean larger, I suppose. Looking up, I see that clouds of incense flock under its beams, some thousand feet up: they are the prayers of the Saints, the angel says. He bids me remove my sandals (I ignore his instruction) and takes leave. I am surprised to find no secretary present to attend to His Holiness, though there is a small display by the door, similar to our electronic devices. I assume it has been left in search mode, since the current window reads: “Search by mansion.” I had read somewhere that every being who lives within the realm of the city has a mansion of their own, and what a generous Almighty His Holiness must be Who gives them great homes and grants me an audience in the midst of His unceasing duties. The interface changes as I touch it—a crystalline Liquid Pearl Display (LPD). It can also be made to search by saint, angel, or higher being. (Depending on my search criteria I get one or three results for higher being.) I put my name in under “Saint,” and it returns the following error: “404. The Saint you were looking for could not be found.” Some things have not changed, but my omission from the database is understandable: I am granted itinerary here only while conducting this interview. I do long however to stay in one of those mansions!</p>
<p>I feel a presence nearing the room and instinctively remove my sandals, while a flashing memory tells me I have felt this presence before. When I was young I felt it in church, long before I lost interest in that sort of thing. The feeling now is much more powerful—a passionate, pure, even perfect presence. My idea of a level-headed interview begins to wane as the feeling grows and the train of presence sweeps across the room. In its gale the candlelight glows brighter and the golden utensils tinkle nervously.</p>
<p>Then He, the Almighty, walks in. It seems the room itself cannot contain the weight of His presence, for even the floor beneath me begins to tremor at His footsteps. I casually fall prostrate before the Almighty (I am told by the Gatekeeper that this is customary).</p>
<p>“Who are you,” the Almighty thunders, “and where have you come from?”</p>
<p>“Sinner,” I reply while standing to my feet, “from the Earth.”</p>
<p>“Sinner, Child of the Earth, please sit down.” He points to a small desk I had not noticed, in the center of the Holiest Place. It has one chair. In the presence of a vast Being I suddenly feel the inadequacy of a desk, but I find that my papers spread easily across its face.</p>
<p>“Sinner, Child of the Earth, I have anticipated this meeting from eternity past. Tell me about yourself.”</p>
<p>His face is stern, but His voice is raw and warm like flowing honey; in such a broad presence the words I had prepared dissolve from my mind. I had not considered how nervous I would be in the presence of the Almighty, especially in light of how many interviews I have previously conducted at Christian organizations. For a few moments I quiver without words.</p>
<p>“We shall revisit that one then,” says the Almighty. “Now tell me, you are applying for ‘Child of God,’ is that correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” The word comes out with less difficulty.</p>
<p>“Why do you want this position, Sinner?”</p>
<p>I recall with photographic precision the job title requirements. Candidate’s moral background must be above reproach. Candidate must show independence and exemplary life. Candidate must demonstrate record of charity. Candidate must be well-versed in Christian literature. I had spent countless days preparing my answers with these criteria in mind, the thought of which assures me.</p>
<p>“For one, You Holiness,” I begin, “I feel I would be a great fit for this position. I have an extensive history as an attending member of Your house, a <em>passion</em> for charity, specialization in the study of Your church—as well as a profound interest in the things of God. I can help grow Your kingdom by strategizing Your evangelization methods and modernizing recruitment curricula.”</p>
<p>“Sinner, I do My business with the broken in spirit, not the proud in heart. Our three-fold management does not take pleasure in working with difficult personnel, and We are looking for a sinner who is humble and desirous to be molded, rather than to mold. Our last stiff-necked employee, Israel, was made to undergo sensitivity training for forty years; We wish to avoid future incidents and discontinue the program altogether. My servant Moses the Prophet could elaborate on the affair…”</p>
<p>“I truly wish I had time,” I interrupt. “But Your Holiness, if You are not looking for someone to help mold your kingdom, what do You seek?”</p>
<p>“A tender heart.”</p>
<p>“I see. I shall make that one of my short-term goals.”</p>
<p>“I would make it a long-term pursuit. Few have garnered that quality and none have gained it without patience. Now tell me, what you are doing now, and why you are in the job market?”</p>
<p>“Well, in addition to my doctorate and numerous certifications, I have recently taken up private study in church history and organization. I am eager to learn from Your Holiness and Your servants on the things of God.”</p>
<p>“That is an admirable,” says the Almighty, “but you must know that some of my previous employees—Simon Peter and D.L. Moody, for instance—had not the education you have, and yet I used their foolishness to confound the wise. In this Kingdom, the fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge…and of wisdom.”</p>
<p>“Wisdom?” I say, surprised by the Almighty’s answer. The job description said nothing of this as a requirement, and it seems His Holiness has entirely dismissed my credentials.</p>
<p>“Almighty,” I venture, “It seems You do not respect intelligence like my previous employers have. What are You looking for, if knowledge is not foremost?”</p>
<p>“Reverence.”</p>
<p>“Reverence,” I repeat as I carelessly scribble the word on my notepad. Perhaps I had chosen the wrong Being to interview with for this opening.</p>
<p>“Now,” says the Almighty, “I understand from My omniscience that you are currently the founding CEO of your organization, and that you have plans to become a pastor—”</p>
<p>“Church speaker.” I grow nervous. I did not think He had read my LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>The Almighty’s eyes flicker curiously. “Given your current obligations and pursuits,” He continues, “where do you see yourself, say, five years from now?”</p>
<p>“Well,” say I while shifting in my seat, “of course I would plan to stay on as ‘Child of God’ till the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>“So this position would serve as a…<em>certification</em> to your becoming a ‘church speaker?’”</p>
<p>I shudder at His word choice. I have been careful not to depict this position as merely a stepping stone in my career, though clearly it must be. “You see Sinner,” He explains, “We are looking for someone who is endeavoring to grow <em>with</em> Our Kingdom. In the hiring process We frequently encounter double-minded candidates—tossed by the wind, as it were—and We wish to ensure you are not one of them.”</p>
<p>That was an embarrassing blunder, I think to myself; perhaps I have been too vocal elsewhere about my aspirations. “Sir—Holiness—what quality would You want in an employee that would convince You he will continue on with the kingdom?”</p>
<p>“That,” the Almighty answers easily, “would be childlike faith. I would inquire concerning how you handle a mission that appears prone to failure, but I already perceive your lack of faith. On another subject, why don’t you tell Me about your pursuits outside of your career—your family, interests, priorities, values?”</p>
<p>I am more than prepared for this question: “Besides enjoying time with my <em>wonderful</em> wife and two beautiful children, I fill my evenings with reading (philosophy and non-fiction), daily exercise, and The History Channel. I occupy my weekend with a counseling service I run out of my home. Every moment I have is spent in activity.”</p>
<p>“Impressive schedule—I can certainly understand why you have no time for devotions. It is a pity that we do not have more time; I recall a certain six-day deadline to create your universe, yet unlike you I found time to rest on the seventh. Those were such days. Considering your overwhelming schedule, can you describe your thought life? What occupies your mind?”</p>
<p>“Why obviously my duties at my organization are the chiefest object of my thoughts, but beyond that, thoughts on politics, eBay deals, beach houses, and my state’s football team engross me.”</p>
<p>“Sinner, I am concerned with your disposition to preoccupy your time and thoughts on the temporal things of life. Not only are we looking for a candidate with a tender heart, reverence, and childlike faith, we also expect him to perpetually occupy himself with his position as a Child of God, as evidenced by apportionment of his greatest assets: time and imagination.”</p>
<p>“I would guess then you are seeking a further quality…perhaps a surrendered life?”</p>
<p>“You are catching on, Sinner.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless Almighty, what of my donations to your establishment? Surely treasures must evidence a surrendered life.”</p>
<p>The Almighty pauses and turns His face. The silence is astonishing, and from such a weighty Being inappropriate. By and by he turns back, and I see pain written in His eyes—eyes akin to the father who has watched his own child go astray. The Almighty’s lighted cheeks now glisten with tears while the once wholesome presence abates, and with a deep sigh He answers:</p>
<p>“Sinner, I am looking for someone who shows the same kindness to his fellow man that he does to his Maker. That I see you lack.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand?” I ask bewilderingly.</p>
<p>“You give your income freely to My cause, and yet withhold the gift of forgiveness from your father.”</p>
<p>I turn red. “Your Holiness, with all due respect that matter is private and has little to do with this position. Is there not a more applicable question You have for me? Perhaps concerning the rigors of my Doctorate in Philanthropic Studies?”</p>
<p>“Sinner, your heart is bent on enmity! Those who love only for reciprocal affection are not the kind Our Kingdom wants.”</p>
<p>“My father did not want me either,” I hiss. “How can I forgive him?”</p>
<p>“You are right: your father did not want you before you were born. You overheard your mother speak of his repulsion to having a child, and you have harbored a vessel of resentment since. He has long repented of antipathy and even now abhors himself for ever wishing you away. Shall I accept offerings from your open hand but ignore your closed heart?”</p>
<p>I dare not answer.</p>
<p>“For I, the LORD,” He says with burning lips, “desire compassion, and not a sacrifice. Take care lest you neglect the weightier provisions of the Law as many of My early employees have. But you have forgotten the forgiveness I have shown you by My own Son’s death; should not you too extend this forgiveness if you wish to partake in My business?”</p>
<p>I turn from His view, stung by that stern, pitying face. I cannot think of my barren heart without abhorring myself like my father did. “Compassion,” I murmur while trying to contain my weeping.</p>
<p>“Now,” says the Almighty reassuringly, “you never told me about this company you founded.”</p>
<p>It takes me many minutes to recover from self-loathing, but by and by I take up the courage to answer.</p>
<p>“It is the third largest charitable organization in the country,” I say dispirited, “but there must be a greater service You seek, in the knowledge of which a business is nothing.”</p>
<p>“You are correct Sinner, for charity, not a charitable body, is the greatest of commandments: to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind. The greatest of all virtues is love...and so it is a loving heart that you lack.”</p>
<p>My hopes for this position have disintegrated, for the Almighty has brought me to my lowest. If He has shown me anything, it is how evil I am.</p>
<p>“Almighty—Father, is there any hope for me to gain this position? My whole life I have prepared under the requirements of this job description in my hands. These qualifications, amassed from family, peers, and even Christian assemblies, cannot satisfy the demands this position.”</p>
<p>“There is Hope,” says the Almighty. “But first I have one last question: the hardest one.”</p>
<p>“Almighty Father, I am so devastated that no other question can bring me lower than I already am, for you have exposed my shame beyond doubt.”</p>
<p>“But this question brings Hope; so bear it with faith. I pray, tell me about a time you failed.”</p>
<p>Is it not obvious? Does not the reek of my prideful, unforgiving, unfaithful heart fill His nostrils? I could furnish a library with the records of my sin, and how is it He ask me for a single time I failed?</p>
<p>“Father, you know my unworthiness; I cannot count the times I have failed.”</p>
<p>“It is a good answer. Now add this to your ledger: a repentant soul.”</p>
<p>“It is already on my heart,” I cry. “I see now that my life is devoid of the qualities to suit this position. Give me this hope, or I will die of sorrow!”</p>
<p>“The Hope, and the answer, was proclaimed by your lips at the first. Now that you have answered My last question, tell me your name again.”</p>
<p><em>“Sinner,”</em> I reply. A sudden horror gropes within: how it has never dawned on me that my name—my title since birth—is so disgusting. Despicable. The Almighty reads well my reaction.</p>
<p>“Your name means you have missed the mark. You cannot redraw the archer’s arrow, and thus the Hope of change lies with me. If I could train you in these qualities—a tender heart, reverence, childlike faith, a surrendered life, compassion, a loving heart, and a repentant soul—will you accept the terms and cost of this position?”</p>
<p>I bite my lips, unsure how to put my groanings into words.</p>
<p>“Sinner, Child of the Earth, speak your thoughts.”</p>
<p>My lips finally discern the words to say, as if He Himself put them on my tongue.</p>
<p>“Lord, have mercy on me, a <em>sinner.”</em></p>
<p>“My Son’s HR department specially employs <em>sinners.</em> You shall be called Child of God from hereon,” He smiles rapturously as He shakes my hand. “Welcome, <em>Adopted,</em> to the Kingdom.”</p>

<p>Every composer is fated to be asked this question by strangers at Starbucks, audience members backstage, and keen pupils in lofty classrooms. It is a question that makes us stutter.</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, no two composers adhere to the same method.</strong> I know composers who write a piece in one night after weeks of pondering, and others who meticulously finish a predetermined amount of music per day (Miklós Rózsa, one of the greatest film composers of all time, committed to a minute of music a day). Every composer develops his own unique workflow over time. My workflow is characteristic of the right brain and often resembles total anarchy.</p>
<h2 id="howtoavoidhate">How to Avoid Hate</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I hate writing, I love having written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Dorothy Parker, author and critic</p>
<p>Child-birthing new music can be tormenting because the inspiration of the right brain ends long before the double bar, so here is some universal advice to aid you in crafting your own masterwork:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write music with accountability and a timeframe.</strong> Solo hikes can feel seemingly pointless without a guide or end in sight, and so can voluntary compositions. My professor, a musical trailblazer, was able to see me through this painful trek to the journey’s end, and thereafter I had a mental marker of the end. While the pain is still present in newer projects, I manage to write more and more.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t obligate yourself to composing in chronological order.</strong> If you are struggling with one section and already have plans for a later part, start working on a new section. I enjoy writing multiple sections at once, and eventually connecting them like railroad segments.</li>
<li><strong>Establish accomplishment “markers” so you can recognize your progress.</strong> One such marker for me is when I’ve outlined the full scope of a piece in my head or on my dominant instrument; another is adding the tempos, dynamics, and expressive markings to the document.</li>
<li><strong>Edit an old section of music if you have no inspiration for a new section.</strong> When I experience creative droughts, I warm up my brain by adding markings to older material, and within half an hour I am yearning to work on the actual composing.</li>
<li><strong>Write a little every day.</strong> It lessens the pain of jumping into your session, despite how much you accomplish. Even a few measures a day adds up <em>very quickly.</em></li>
<li><strong>Allow periods of listening, then periods of composing.</strong> Some people do both simultaneously, but I prefer to study someone else’s work for a time, then work on my own.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase ear plugs or compose in a sound-proof room.</strong> The musical ear is extremely sensitive to external noises like whistling, the cracking of dishes, or the hum of a fan.</li>
<li><strong>Do not compose with Finale’s playback as your guide.</strong> Even good virtual instruments can distort what you write and negatively influence the way you compose. Finale can make a beautiful melody sound boring and tempt you to add more notes, whereas a true acoustic rendition will likely sound too busy. There are a million reasons to turn off the volume and write from your inner ear. I promise you the sounds in your head will be the better judge.</li>
<li>When fleshing out instrumentation, <strong>get away from your native instrument and constantly listen to music of your intended instrumentation before you write.</strong> Again, unrepresentative sounds must not influence your writing! When I began my string quartet, I used the piano to fill in parts and thus over-orchestrated; this is because piano music requires more notes than a string quartet to sound “rich.” (Reciprocally, I find that non-pianists tend to write too thinly for piano!) Tune your orchestration instincts with plenty of listening, then trust your head as you write. Contrapuntal elements especially can be ineffective on the piano but sound quite natural when played by their intended ensemble.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="myhatefulprocess">My Hateful Process</h2>
<p>As a musical perfectionist, I contend for that magic, organic revelation of the purest, most gorgeous music available outside Heaven’s gates. Aesthetically I am most interested in whether the piece flows organically, like oil off of a frying pan. If a melody or section sounds manufactured or awkward in context, it is probably not the right material for that particular piece.</p>
<p>My process is hardly organic and smooth, and rather an impassioned mixture of ecstasy and frustration. I have moments of writer’s block and mystification suddenly followed by the emergence of a beautiful theme. <strong>That’s why I hate composing and love it at the same time.</strong></p>
<p>And yet the finished product of this explosive process is not inferior; to the contrary, every project with a deadline divinely receives my perfectionist approval.</p>
<p>The actual process starts with perhaps half a melody or a motif. I am persuaded that God plants the initial material in my head: often I will wake up and suddenly internalize a theme complete with instrumentation. These bits of music always have an organic, flowing, right brain flavor that delights my ear for at least ten runs on the piano. After that, I begin experimenting with the idea by improvising and stretching its mechanical use. (I do record the pure material for future writing, given it may take months or years to fully realize its potential. Some melodies/motifs are more flexible than others.) After this “seasoning” period, I formalize the instrumentation/form and expand the material into a full section.</p>
<p>This is where pain begins. When a natural ending to that half-a-melody does not come immediately to me, I begin “left-braining” all my options. Ninety-nine percent of the time what I first conjure up is replaced five more times before the final solution comes. Days and weeks can squirm by without any obvious solutions. At some point after “hammering out” all the available candidates, I wake up one day and suddenly “remember” the second half of the material. “Hey, did you want this?” It is laughable how many versions of a melody I can draft before the melody of my dreams emerges. This kind of workflow characterizes all my pieces to the double bar. I then listen through the piece for pacing, flow, and errors (and sometimes I completely rewrite a section).</p>
<h2 id="hatershistory">Hater’s History</h2>
<p>Before college I could not finish a single piece—<strong>it took teachers, deadlines, and dependent grades to prod me into finishing my first works of music.</strong> My string orchestra overture for a competition took months to finish and weeks to edit; the process was tortuous and only occasionally dotted with “aha!” moments. My second major work, a three-minute brass fanfare for another competition, doubled as an assignment for my composition course. The combination of a deadline and a grade helped me discover exactly how much pain I had to suffer before finishing a piece.</p>
<p>Now after several such deadlines I am writing on my own. Before college I would have scoffed at finishing any work, but this past year (God be praised!) I finished a thirty-minute string quartet. My last piece was barely six minutes.</p>
<p>I encourage new composers to find your own natural writing process by experimenting with different workflows. Set parameters for your work; boldly challenge “dead weight” in your music.</p>
<p>And above all, <em>listen to your ear.</em></p>

<p><strong>You’re famous.</strong></p>
<p>Certainly, there is nothing wrong with getting a Doctorate or playing in luxurious halls. And to those of us currently working toward these goals, let me add my congratulations on a noble pursuit!</p>
<p>This article speaks to those casually considering music, those currently auditioning for the London Symphony Orchestra, and all Christian professionals. Regardless of our caste in the kingdom of musical endeavors, we must never lose sight of a greater picture when pursuing any career.</p>
<p>That bigger picture is the Gospel. I realize that sounds like an archaic statement. Nonetheless, as Christians we are called to surrender our lives to its cause. God certainly has our careers in mind, for He Himself created the arts and gave us our gifts, but He sees them in light of redeemed lives. As important as our careers (temporal pursuits) are, they should serve the Gospel (a message of eternal weight) to be of lasting worth.</p>
<p>God may choose to bless some of us with the “American Dream,” but His great and wondrous plan cannot stop at us having nice jobs, nice homes, and popularity. Our lives would be so empty and meaningless otherwise, and we would find ourselves following the countless stars and CEOs who have ended their lives because of hopelessness.</p>
<h2 id="thetravelerwhohonorsgod">The Traveler Who Honors God</h2>
<p>The blessings that come from honoring God first are richly enumerated throughout the Scriptures. Consider the career of Solomon, the wisest and richest ruler in Israel’s existence and a symbol of success among even unbelievers. Before his rise to greatness, he asked for wisdom—something of eternal value—and God added wealth and fame to him. In this Solomon fulfilled a New Testament principle: “But seek first [God’s] kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A33&amp;version=NASB" title="Matthew 6:33">Matthew 6:33</a>).” God tremendously blessed Solomon’s reign, and it was only when Solomon forgot God and pursued the fruits of earthly success that his kingdom was divided.</p>
<p>While honoring God’s plan is not guaranteed to secure happy careers, it does allow God to direct us toward the ends that will satisfy our souls as well as our dreams.</p>
<h2 id="theroadthatwinds">The Road that Winds</h2>
<p>Many of us take our cue from the vast percentage of performers who have made their careers without the guiding hand of God, and in imitative form we build our own professional lives—forgetting that we have an undiscovered dimension of travel as adopted sons of God. Surely we have a sincere longing to live God’s purpose for our lives, but we follow the world’s prescribed routes to attain God’s destination. Can such highways lead to God’s best?</p>
<p>Moses is an example of how God directs the steps of those who seek His will. Though adopted into the ruling family of Egypt, “…[he] refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+11%3A24-26&amp;version=NASB" title="Hebrews 11:24–26">Hebrews 11:24–26</a>).” Why did Moses not stay and grow in influence over Pharaoh in order to free his kinsmen? In fact, the classic film <em>The Ten Commandments</em> cites this alluring route:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nefretiri: Oh, Moses, the gods have fashioned you for greatness. The splendor of your name will last beyond the pyramids. When you are Pharaoh, you can free your people…<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Scripture says that “[by] faith he left Egypt (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A27&amp;version=NASB" title="Hebrews 11:27a">Hebrews 11:27a</a>),” trusting the unusual path God had ordained. Through winding roads God made him a leader. Could Moses have eventually freed the Hebrews by remaining in Pharaoh’s household? Perhaps, but through his excursion to Midian, God revealed His nature to Moses and taught him lessons that he would not have learned in the glamour of Egypt’s palaces. If Moses had not trusted God’s plan, who can reckon how different Old Testament history would have been? Perhaps God would have chosen someone else to deliver His people.</p>
<p>Perhaps David could have been born into Saul’s royal family (though even Saul was called out of humble circumstances), but God chose instead to cultivate his leadership skills as a shepherd, with a league of witless sheep for his kingdom. Yet who in the Scriptures is best remembered, not only for his influence in Hebrew history, but his testimony as “a man after [God’s] own heart (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+13:22&amp;version=NASB" title="Acts 13:22">Acts 13:22</a>)?” A career left to God does not exclude our gifts and dreams; rather it ushers them into the jurisdiction of eternity. This translation requires that His routes not be bound to where roads are paved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,” declares the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2055:8-9" title="Isaiah 55:8–9">Isaiah 55:8–9</a>).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>ways</em> is the Greek <em>derek,</em> which translates “a way, road, distance, journey, or manner,” and can also refer to conduct or action. God dictates our journey as well as our destination, and from the example of Scripture He often matures us for the destination through the hard roads.</p>
<p>Solomon wisely penned the proverb, “The mind of man plans his way, But the Lord directs his steps (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+16:9&amp;version=NASB" title="Proverbs 16:9">Proverbs 16:9</a>).” The four words <em>plan,</em> <em>way,</em> <em>direct,</em> and <em>steps</em> provide a fascinating study. When the Greek meaning is examined, the verse better reads “the mind of man plans (calculates, imagines) his ways (<em>derek</em>), but the Lord directs (firmly establishes, confirms, prepares) his steps (steps, pace, stride).” Notice that God’s planned route does not remove our responsibility to explore or pursue our options, yet He is the one Who makes our paths sure to the exact step and pace of our travel.</p>
<p><strong>Make your plans, go to college, audition for orchestras—but do not play tug-of-war with God and His unfathomable designs.</strong></p>
<h2 id="adestinationthatfulfills">A Destination that Fulfills</h2>
<p>If it is true that God must guide the journey to our career, it is equally true that He must dictate our final career. God’s highest intent is for our livelihoods to honor Him, and if we let Him lead our journey to begin with it is easier to find the career that honors Him. We cannot hope to honor Him at the destination if we did not honor him on the road; we may even find ourselves in the wrong profession!</p>
<p>Many of us have obvious gifts, so we find it easy to fantasize our professional venue. Sometimes God has similar plans, and other times He has a seemingly unrelated life in mind. In the past He has often tasked His children in areas where natural ability lacked, so that through their weaknesses His power would be clearly seen. <strong>He raised a gang of dirty fishermen to expose the hypocrisy of the learned scribes and Pharisees, and yet called a learned Hebrew scholar to preach a simple message to unclean Gentiles.</strong></p>
<p>Christian moviegoers will no doubt recognize the name “Sherwood Pictures”—now “Kendrick Brothers Productions”—the independent Christian film company operated by brothers Alex, Stephen, and Shannon Kendrick. Their story continues to inspire me. From youth all three brothers showed promise in filmmaking, and I wager that most film professionals would have them sent to Hollywood to develop their talents (as if Hollywood is the only way to become a good filmmaker). At God’s leading however, Alex and Stephen went into ministry and Shannon joined IBM. Through their church they were able to fund their first full-length movie <em><a href="http://www.flywheelthemovie.com" title="Flywheel">Flywheel</a>,</em> which became so popular it sold out multiple times in theater and was later picked up by Blockbuster and Christian bookstores to offset the demand.</p>
<p>The Kendricks are now working on their fifth film after enjoying enormous success nationwide from three other movies: <em><a href="http://www.facingthegiants.com" title="Facing the Giants">Facing the Giants</a>,</em> <em><a href="http://fireproofthemovie.com" title="Fireproof">Fireproof</a>,</em> and <em><a href="http://courageousthemovie.com" title="Courageous">Courageous</a>.</em> <em>Fireproof</em> became the highest grossing independent film of 2008; <em>Courageous</em> was shown in over 1,000 theaters and later released to 20 countries. These movies now represent the best of Christian films, bringing the Gospel to viewers around the world. Their story has become a real-life “Parable of the Talents” and an incredible lesson of how God can use our gifts to make Him famous!</p>
<h2 id="adreamthatlasts">A Dream that Lasts</h2>
<p>Am I suggesting that we should forsake our pursuit of degrees and diplomas, or that climbing the professional ladder is evil? Absolutely not! But if we think our only option for a fulfilling career is to go to such-and-such a school, move to a certain city, or play in a world-famous orchestra, then we risk missing God’s ultimate purpose for us. What if our life is more special—supernatural—than we thought, or what if God’s plan for us is so unique that not even a career as concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic could compare? He makes His ways unrepeatable and His paths unsearchable by our brightest minds and in doing so perpetually eludes the world. Let us trust our Heavenly Trail Blazer to guide our professional lives <em>en route</em> and <em>à l’arrivée.</em></p>

<img src="https://www.manuscriptmaster.com/content/images/2016/01/Cross.jpg" alt="The Moral Hedge, Pt. 3"><p>I have frequently encountered moral dilemmas within the context of all three tests (see <a href="http://manuscriptmastr.com/the-moral-hedge-pt-1/" title="The Moral Hedge, Pt. 1">Part One</a> and <a href="http://manuscriptmastr.com/the-moral-hedge-pt-2/" title="The Moral Hedge, Pt. 2">Part Two</a>). While I could have easily dismissed my qualms as over-sensitivity, I instead set my mind to glorify Christ in the minutest areas of life. Correct response to art in this world takes courage and discernment, but there are Scriptural guidelines to making the right choice about supporting certain artistic endeavors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen to your conscience. Do not ignore that nudge in your spirit that dislikes something about the art. It may be a red flag to the presence of deeper evils. Sometimes I attended numerous rehearsals before listening to this “nagging” and backing out of the questionable project.</li>
<li>Apply the three tests:
<ul>
<li>Is the artwork inherently evil?</li>
<li>Does the artwork serve an immoral purpose?</li>
<li>Does the artwork represent something denounced by Scripture?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In subtler matters, consult the Holy Spirit for guidance in deciding whether or not to support an artistic cause; pray when the moral ramifications are clouded, but do not hesitate to act when the dilemma is a clear compromise of God’s law.</li>
<li>Trust God to work out the logistics of backing out of a project for moral reasons. This is always the hardest step because we may feel the pressure of being “needed” or “required” to contribute to the project, and it is easy for the imagination to conjure up complications. These are the defining moments to see just how big your God is. Finding a performer to replace you or substituting another assignment for your nude sketch is child’s play for God. And may I say, in the times I’ve been faced with compromise (and they are all too many these days), God has <em>always</em> given me a way out.</li>
<li>Most importantly, <strong>become the alternative to vile art by creating, joining, and supporting artistic projects that portray pure values.</strong> As we discovered with Aaron and Bezalel, everything we fashion can be used to please either God or Satan.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="encouragement">Encouragement</h2>
<p>Before I conclude, allow me to share a couple dilemmas from my own life; I pray they will inspire you to treasure a pure conscience and discern wisely in the arts.</p>
<p>In my college world literature class with a highly-rated professor, I was faced with an assignment to read and discuss an extremely graphic and sensual book. It was, as I understand, the equivalent of written pornography. I have been careful my entire life to preserve the innocence of my conscience (a precious asset, regardless of what my peers would say), and to fill my head with such filthy content would arouse desires contrary to God’s will. I approached my professor about substituting another work for it, and after expressing her initial shock at being asked such an unusual question, she agreed to a substitute. We met together to discuss choices, and incredibly we agreed on the Book of Job, which contained both the pure truths I longed for and the deep philosophy she sought. It was not an easy substitution! Until then I had never grappled with the sobering lessons of this book, and not only did I begin to understand God’s character in an entirely new way, but both I and my professor were thoroughly pleased with the resulting essay.</p>
<p>At another point in my studies, I and another composer made a bargain: he would conduct a work of mine if I performed piano in his work. Both pieces were to be premiered in the same recital. At the first rehearsal, I learned that his work was intended to portray gambling and sensuality. This background would likely be explained at the performance as well, and for me to perform in seeming concurrence with those themes would misrepresent Christ’s law. Although I didn’t know how I would find a replacement for my part, I backed out and offered to pay him to conduct my piece. He eventually secured another pianist, and I maintained an upright conscience knowing that I had fled from compromise.</p>
<h2 id="finalwords">Final Words</h2>
<p>I have done my best to enumerate what I believe Scripture teaches, but I am fallible like any other man and woefully inclined to error. I realize most of the conclusions I have reached are black and white, and I welcome friendly discussion in discerning specific issues of morality and art. My intention was not to classify every situation, but to generate <em>intentional thought</em> on how we handle the arts as Christ-ambassadors.</p>
<p>Let me leave you with a parting thought, a fourth test: the attitude of the heart. When the Israelites continuously rebelled against God, He observed that they “…dr[e]w near with their words and honor Me with their lip service, but they remove[d] their hearts far from Me, and their reverence for Me consist[ed] of tradition learned by rote (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+29&amp;version=NASB" title="Isaiah 29:13b">Isaiah 29:13b</a>)…” Even when Israel ostensibly followed His Law, their wayward hearts declared disobedience. We can never please God while we caress the filthiness that clings to our hearts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What are your multiplied sacrifices to Me?” Says the Lord. “I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed cattle; and I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs or goats…<strong>[b]ring your worthless offerings no longer,</strong> incense is an abomination to Me. New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies—I cannot endure iniquity and the solemn assembly. <strong>I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts,</strong> they have become a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them…[w]ash yourselves, make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from My sight. <strong><em>Cease</em> to do evil, <em>learn</em> to do good; <em>seek</em> justice, <em>reprove</em> the ruthless, <em>defend</em> the orphan, <em>plead</em> for the widow</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+1&amp;version=NASB" title="Isaiah 1:11–17">Isaiah 1:11–17</a>).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seek</em> justice, <em>learn</em> to do good, <em>reprove</em> the ruthless, <em>cease</em> to do evil, <em>defend</em> the orphan, <em>plead</em> for the widow. Notice God did not stop at “be just,” “do good,” “don’t be ruthless,” etc. “Seek,” “learn,” and “reprove” unanimously declare the inclination of our heart toward these things. Is our heart attitude “What can I get away with?” or “How can I best please God in this circumstance?” If it is the first, we are guilty of impurity. Joshua Harris defined purity as “…a direction, a persistent, determined pursuit of righteousness…[which] flees opportunities for compromise (Harris 88).”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>A direction. Not a destination. The moment we become content to barely appease God is when we give Satan the wheel to drive us down the “slippery slope” to greater evils. I repeat, it is not for fear that we avoid evil, but for our love of God and fellow men that we sanctify ourselves from the rot and stench of immoral artwork. Let us be faithful to God with our artistic choices, for He surely honors those who honor Him (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%202&amp;version=NLT" title="1 Samuel 2:30b">1 Samuel 2:30b</a>).</p>

<p>Continuing the line of thought from <a href="http://manuscriptmastr.com/the-moral-hedge-pt-1/" title="The Moral Hedge, Pt. 1">Part One</a>, Scripture clearly indicates that art <em>does</em> carry moral weight. For the Christian, where is the line between what is acceptable and what is not? How can it be found? The first two tests we have derived are such:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Is the artwork inherently good or evil?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is the artwork’s intended purpose for pure or evil ends?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A third we shall add, although there is a great deal of overlap amongst them. But first, I must add an interjection.</p>
<h2 id="thetestamentofconscienceholyspirit">The Testament of Conscience &amp; Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Here on, the distinction between right and wrong becomes more difficult to discern, though that does not minimize our responsibility to correctly judge between them. This is why God gave us His Holy Spirit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16&amp;version=NASB" title="John 16:13–14">John 16:13–14</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has given us a Helper to distinguish these things, so we are never left to our own hunches. Furthermore, He has equipped all men with a conscience to perceive basic right and wrong. Paul attests that the conscience is present in both believers and non-believers alike, “so that all men are without excuse:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For when Gentiles who do not have the Law <strong>do instinctively</strong> the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, <strong>their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2&amp;version=NASB" title="Romans 2:14–16">Romans 2:14–16</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between these two helpers, the Christian has no reason to neglect discernment. Let us therefore not become lazy in our rightful jurisdiction, but sift through these things attentively. There is almost no such thing as a “gray zone,” although the line may be dangerously faint and may shift based on the believer’s own conscience.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="thedefiningquestion">The Defining Question</h2>
<p>While it is straightforward to determine from Scripture whether crafting an idol is right or wrong, it is noticeably harder to test more sensitive issues. For instance, is there a difference between pornography and the nude paintings Michelangelo painted in the Sistine Chapel? Let us assume that he crafted these works with godly intentions: to stimulate the marvel of God’s works (thereby passing the test of purpose). The human body, created by God, bears both His image and signature, and apart from the stain of sin it passes the test of inherent evil. Still, there is a third test we may conduct on the art in question.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Is the artwork inherently good or evil?</em></li>
<li><em>Is the artwork’s intended purpose for pure or evil ends?</em></li>
<li><strong>Does the artwork represent Christ and align with His teachings?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This principle is Biblical because believers are called “ambassadors of Christ” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians+5&amp;version=NASB" title="2 Corinthians 5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>). We are “Little Christs” (which is the literal translation of the word <em>Christian)</em> and must not defame Christ by misrepresenting Him. Keep in mind that Christ Himself followed God’s precepts and biddings—a call we share as His earth-bound representers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; <strong>for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205&amp;version=NASB" title="John 5:19b">John 5:19b</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the Christian’s artistic moral dilemmas concern participation in an artistic piece, and in these situations we must ask whether we can represent a certain work of art and Christ simultaneously. Because we must represent Christ and Christ follows God’s precepts, it is logical that our call as ambassadors is to both follow and correctly represent His law. Any work of art that causes us to misrepresent God’s commandments is wrong.</p>
<p>Is it wrong to draw nude individuals? Genesis informs us that before the Fall Adam and Eve were innocent to the point of not recognizing their own nakedness. When they sinned, shame fell upon them, and God Himself covered them so that they were not exposed. Since then, Scripture handles nakedness very differently, beginning only six chapters later in Genesis 9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Noah began farming and planted a vineyard. He drank of the wine and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent. Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned away, so that they did not see their father’s nakedness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209&amp;version=NASB" title="Genesis 9:20–24">Genesis 9:20–24</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the context it seems Ham did not merely stumble in on his unclothed father by accident (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209&amp;version=NASB" title="Genesis 9:25">Genesis 9:25</a>). Perhaps he stared, perhaps he jested. But we can easily infer that he disgraced Noah by not honoring the sacredness of the body (though tainted by sin from the Fall), and so looked on with baser instincts and did not cover his father. In contrast, Shem and Japheth honored their father by both covering him and not exposing their own eyes to his nakedness. What a severe distinction between Noah’s words regarding Ham and those for his other two sons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him. So he said, “Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants he shall be to his brothers…Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant. May God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209&amp;version=NASB" title="Genesis 9:25–27">Genesis 9:25–27</a>).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sinful flesh of man can no longer view the exposed body with innocence (a clean conscience unaware of sin). We must reconcile ourselves to the reality of our flesh and realize some things are not permissible for man to look on because of the Fall. Man knows well the mind’s proclivity to lust after another individual’s body, particularly unclothed. Jesus told us that to lust is to have already committed adultery in the mind (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205&amp;version=NASB" title="Matthew 5:27–30">Matthew 5:27–30</a>). Between the Biblical interdiction to look at the naked human figure and the enormous temptation to lust and commit sin, it must be concluded that <em>any</em> field which promotes the presentation of an unclothed individual is at fault. Even nude painting done in the name of Christianity is at fault! Irrespective of Michelangelo’s intentions, his presentation of the unclothed figure “in the name of art” is forbidden by Scripture. We must stop the Christian naivety by hedging this so-called “Christian artwork” from the law of Scripture. Michaelangelo was born long after inspired Scripture, and however noble or perhaps godly he might have been,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> his work is not so “sacred” as to be elevated above the precepts of Christ’s Law, nor has it been morally spayed by the passage of time.</p>
<p>It is irrelevant whether a nude painting has been labeled as “Christian artwork” or “pornography,” and unless we pretend that the regenerate Christian has taken leave of his lustful body, we must not tempt our weak flesh (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+14&amp;version=NASB" title="Mark 14:38">Mark 14:38</a>). Only after the conscience has been cleansed of the knowledge of sin can one look upon the human body with perfect innocence. God has promised this when we are given new bodies fit for Heaven, but until then, we are forbidden to view the unclothed body. Portraying the naked human body in a church or cathedral only misrepresents Biblical teaching, and so creation, engagement, or promotion of such artwork is wrong.</p>
<h2 id="applyingthethirdtest">Applying the Third Test</h2>
<p>What a thorny quandary to follow to its Biblical conclusion! When we apply the representation test to other artistic dilemmas, things become clearer still. What about music or a film that positively portrays adultery, sorcery, or assault? First, let us ask whether Christ would condone those practices? Of course not. Second, as a Christian—and therefore an ambassador of Christ’s law—is it morally acceptable for me to depict these practices as anything but evil? It cannot be, or I would be a double-minded man by representing two natures at polar variance with each other. I therefore could not support such portrayals by performing or acting in them.</p>
<p>What if a piece of music is truly abstract, but the artist is morally loose? Again the question of representation emerges. While I may have a freed conscience to perform one of his pieces without condemnation, there is the possibility I might misrepresent Christ to my audience by singing his music. Imagine I have auditioned to perform Tchaikovsky’s Pathetique Symphony, or Copland’s Appalachian Spring. Both are pieces of abstract music, but Tchaikovsky and Copland were homosexuals (a practice the Bible clearly condemns as wrong in many passages such as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20&amp;version=NASB" title="Leviticus 20:13">Leviticus 20:13</a>). My conscience is clean because there is nothing inherently wrong with the music or its intended purpose, and most of the audience is unaware of either man’s background. Playing one of their pieces will not cause the average listener to question my faith, so I could perform and represent Christ at the same time. But suppose I performed one of Elton John or Michael Jackson’s “cleaner tunes” for an average audience. Who from this generation is ignorant of these men’s godless lifestyles? Few indeed. To perform these works would confuse the conscience of the listener, so that the mere act of singing may prove a stumbling block to those who thoughtfully examine whether Christ changes lives. For me to sing such works would be a gross misrepresentation of Christ.</p>
<p>Now it sounds like I am in fear of my image. Far from it! I would gladly forsake the Nutcracker if it kept me from becoming a stumbling block to another Christian musician (well-acquainted with Tchaikovsky’s life) who previously struggled with homosexuality. It is not for fear of perception, but concern for the conscience of others, that I would deny such things. (This alludes to the “disputable matters” Paul discusses in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14&amp;version=NASB" title="Romans 14">Romans 14</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%208&amp;version=NASB" title="1 Corinthians 8">1 Corinthians 8</a>.)</p>
<p>In <a href="http://manuscriptmastr.com/the-moral-hedge-pt-3/" title="The Moral Hedge, Pt. 3">Part Three</a>, I will share some true stories from my own life and practical steps to discerning within the arts. I continue to welcome discussion!</p>
